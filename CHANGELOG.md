# Changelog

All notable changes to the flow-next.

Flow-Next changed shape with 5.0.0. One command, `/flow-next:flow`, reads whatever you have and picks the route, and `flow --auto` runs the same route unattended. If you are arriving from 4.x, start with [the 5.0.0 entry](#flow-next-500---2026-09-12) and [the flow skill](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-flow/SKILL.md) before reading the items below.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Choose independent CLI re-reviews when needed.** `review.reReviewSession=fresh`
  starts one new Codex, Copilot, Cursor or Claude reviewer session after each fix,
  carrying the full prior findings and preserving the review route and receipt
  lineage. `resume` remains the built-in default. `FLOW_RE_REVIEW_SESSION` sets
  a user default across projects; an explicit project setting or one-call
  `--re-review-session` takes precedence. First-round panels are unchanged.
## [flow-next 8.1.0] - 2026-10-06

Teams that keep specs on feature branches can now see each other's in-flight specs. One command lists every spec across your local branches and the branches your teammates pushed, says which copies carry unmerged changes, and flags the ones whose merge would conflict, in about a second on a repository with 130 branches and 270 specs. Plan's spec scout reads it, so a new plan finds overlapping work on other branches as well as what is checked out. The teams guide now answers the branching question directly: three supported shapes, and the habits (push, fetch, delete merged branches) that keep the picture accurate.

### Added

- **See specs on every branch.** `flowctl specs --refs` lists each spec on the base branch, your local branches and remote-tracking branches. A branch's copy counts as live when merging that branch would change the spec, and as stale when it carries nothing new (an older copy, a squash-merged copy, or a spec deleted on main), so old branches do not drown out real work. A live copy whose merge would conflict is flagged with the date of the branch's last commit. It works offline on the refs you already have; `--fetch` prune-fetches origin first and still answers from local refs when the fetch fails. Plain `flowctl specs` is unchanged. Docs: [For teams](https://flow-next.dev/guides/for-teams/#specs-across-branches) and the [CLI reference](https://flow-next.dev/flowctl/cli-reference/#specs-across-branches).
- **Plans see overlapping work on other branches.** Plan's spec scout includes specs with unmerged changes on other branches and names the branch in each finding. It records a dependency only on a spec that is in your checkout, and reports a spec that exists only on another branch as an overlap. With an older flowctl the scout keeps its checkout-only behaviour.

### Changed

- **Setup explains plan-sync.** The setup summary now says that plan-sync is off by default, that a config written by an older init may still have it on, and what turning it on costs: work runs waves instead of the rolling scheduler. It also says that a single-task or no-plan spec never has later tasks for plan-sync to update, and gives the command that turns it off.

## [flow-next 8.0.0] - 2026-10-05

Every reviewer now gives your change the same review. A small change in one area gets one reviewer and anything larger gets three (correctness, contracts, integration), merged into one fix pass, whether the review runs on Codex, Claude, Copilot, Cursor or the host and whichever harness you run flow-next in. Switching reviewer no longer changes how closely a change is checked: before this release only Codex and host reviews sized the panel, and the other three always sent one reviewer.

Reviews are also more honest about what they covered. A one-task spec now has the project's standing criteria checked by the review that already runs. A stuck review loop reviews your latest fix before it gives up. A reviewer that runs out of credits reports the provider's own message instead of looking like a broken setup, and a spec you refine after its plan review goes back through plan review before work picks it up. Specs that end without being built can close as retired, with the reason on record.

**What changes when you upgrade.** RepoPrompt support is gone: the `rp` reviewer, the `flowctl rp` commands, `/flow-next:export-context` and plan review's export mode. A project that still names `rp` or `export` gets a one-line notice and continues with no reviewer until you pick one, for example `flowctl config set review.backend codex`. `review.backend` itself stays (7.1.0 said it would go; it doesn't). Scripts that call `flowctl review-rounds record` must pass `--backend`, which no longer defaults to `rp`. A plan review can now read `stale`, so anything that reads `plan_review_status` should treat it like `needs_work`. Re-run the Codex, OpenCode or Cursor installer to drop the removed skill.

### Added

- **Close a spec that ends without being built.** A spec that another spec superseded, that became moot, or that shipped under other work can now close truthfully: `flowctl spec close <id> --retire superseded|moot|delivered-elsewhere [--by <spec-or-PR>]` records why it ended and what replaced it. Its never-run tasks read `retired` instead of `done`, completion review records `not_required` so every close and merge gate accepts it, `flowctl next` stops routing to it, and land and make-pr count a pull request that retires a task-less spec as carrying that spec. `show`, `specs` and `list` print the end state as `retired: <reason> by <refs>`. The won't-do close in the flow-next skill uses it. Thanks @sn-furali (#503).

### Changed

- **Every reviewer gets the same panel.** Claude, Copilot and Cursor reviews now run the first round the way Codex and host reviews did: one reviewer for a small diff in one area that touches no persisted or shared state, concurrency, security or data layout, three reviewers (correctness, contracts, integration) for anything larger, merged into one fix pass and counted as one round. The re-review after fixes is one reviewer everywhere. It works from any harness, so flow-next in Codex with the `claude` reviewer takes the same steps as flow-next in Claude Code with `codex`. Each Claude reviewer in a three-reviewer round gets the reviewed diff by path. A branch review no longer needs a `.flow/` project on any backend. Under the hood: `flowctl <backend> impl-review-fanout` and `impl-review-fanout-finalize` exist for all four CLI backends, the four per-backend implementation-review workflows became one, and receipts keep their format.
- **A stuck review loop reviews your latest fix before it stops.** The stall check used to refuse the next round as soon as the reviewer marked the same finding `not-fixed` twice, so the fix you had just committed was never reviewed. It now ends the loop only when the reviewer marks the same finding `not-fixed` in three consecutive rounds, reported right after that round's verdict is recorded, and never refuses a round whose fix has not been reviewed yet.
- **One-task specs get their standing criteria checked.** A spec with a single task skips completion review, the review that judges `.flow/criteria.md`, so those criteria were never checked on the default route. That task's implementation review now judges them, and a violated criterion is a finding like any other. Specs without a criteria file review exactly as before.
- **`review.backend` stays.** 7.1.0 said the setting would leave in 8.0.0 in favour of the model-routing block. It stays: the reviewer is still chosen with `review.backend`, a spec's or task's review setting, or `--review=`, and nothing needs migrating.

### Fixed

- **A review that hits a usage limit says so.** When the codex account behind a review ran out of credits or reached its usage limit, every draw failed within seconds as `nonzero_exit`, the skill retried, and the terminal said to repair a backend that was healthy. A review that returns no verdict now records the CLI's own last error text (the last codex `error` event; the last output line on the other CLIs) on the attempt row and the draw's result, and prints it after `CLI message:` in the failure line and the `TRANSPORT_UNHEALTHY` text. When that message reports a usage, credit or spend limit, the review skills stop with it instead of retrying. Thanks @sn-furali (#515).
- **A spec rewritten after its plan review is reviewed again before work.** `spec set-plan` left a plan-review `ship` in place when it changed the spec, so a spec refined after its SHIP went straight to work with tasks written for the old criteria. A body change now sets a `ship` plan review to `stale`: work stops on it, `flow` and `flow --auto` run plan-review first whatever the task count, and refine names `/flow-next:plan-review <id>` as the next step after it changes a planned spec. Specs that were never plan-reviewed route as before. Thanks @sn-furali (#514).
- **Land reports a merge queue.** Under a merge queue, land's merge call adds the PR to the queue and the PR stays open, which land did not cover. It now reports `QUEUED` and tells you to run `/flow-next:land <PR>` again once the PR merges; that run moves the linked issue. Thanks @sn-furali (#516).
- **Host reviews record what they reviewed.** A host review's attempt row now carries the reviewed `base_sha` and `head_sha` (marked observed) and the reviewer's model, like every other reviewer, so a check that counts which commits a review covered can count host reviews too. `flowctl review-rounds increment --base/--head` keeps the range on the reservation and `review-rounds record` takes an optional `--model`. Thanks @sn-furali (#513).
- **Host review finds the model-routing block in CLAUDE.md as well as AGENTS.md**, whichever file holds it on the harness, instead of always naming AGENTS.md.
- **A reviewer's note after a location no longer voids the round.** A finding whose location carried text after the line or range, such as `store.py:18-25 (with ...)` or a backticked location followed by a note, failed the findings parser, and the review's merge plan then refused the whole round until the merged file was supplied by hand. The location now parses to its path and lines on every reviewer.
- **`spec set-backend` and `task set-backend` errors name the flag.** An invalid value printed `<function field at 0x...>` where `--impl`, `--review` or `--sync` belonged.
- **Smaller fixes.** On Codex, the unattended `flow --auto` driver and the plan, implementation and spec completion review fix loops no longer carry an instruction to stop and ask the user. resolve-pr posts a reply that starts with `@` or is just a number or `true` as the text written, instead of reading a file or failing. Implementation review's context hints survive a git config that forces colored `grep` output. Capture's autofix write gate takes only an exact `--yes` (and `--override-strategy` only exactly), so a lookalike such as `--yesterday` no longer authorizes a write. The Codex plugin manifest counts 29 skills, not 30. A change that renames a code file into a docs path is no longer skipped as docs-only by review triage, and reviewers see both sides of a rename. The tier pick reads a task's whole Acceptance section even when it holds a fenced `## ` line. resolve-pr's comment lookups send the owner and repo as text.

### Removed

- **Reviews run on codex, host, claude, copilot or cursor; RepoPrompt is gone.** The `rp` review backend, the `flowctl rp` commands, `/flow-next:export-context` and plan review's `--review=export` mode were deprecated in 7.1.0 and are removed, so there is no macOS-only reviewer left to set up. A project that still names `rp` or `export` (in `review.backend`, `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND`, a spec's or task's review setting, or `--review=`) gets a one-line notice saying so and continues with no reviewer configured: pick another reviewer with `flowctl config set review.backend <name>`. Re-run the Codex, OpenCode or Cursor installer to drop the export-context skill from an existing install. QA receipts written for a pipeline now record mode `receipt` instead of `rp`; receipts already on disk still read.

## [flow-next 7.1.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **QA can record a NO or BLOCKED pass that has no findings.** A QA pass can end short of SHIP without any finding to list: a criterion nobody could drive in the running app, or a run blocked before it started. `flowctl qa receipt` refused to write those receipts ("QA findings could not be parsed"), so the result never reached the pull request, and an unattended `flow --auto` run treated QA as if it had errored. Those receipts are written again, with their coverage and blocked reason as the explanation. Code reviews still reject an empty NEEDS_WORK.

## [flow-next 7.1.1] - 2026-10-03

A small patch from the first day of 7.1 in the wild. Upgrading from an older checkout now leaves you with exactly the skills and commands this release ships, memory-migrate keeps every lesson from very old memory files, and make-pr works with a Bitbucket create command. Thank you to everyone who reported these.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Codex users: re-run `scripts/install-codex.sh` once. It moves any leftover skill folder and the old `interview` and `pilot` prompts into `~/.codex/.flow-next-retired/`, where nothing is deleted. OpenCode and Cursor-script installs pick up the fix the same way.

### Fixed

- **Installers skip folders that aren't skills.** When a release removes a skill, `git pull` can leave its folder behind if untracked files such as `__pycache__` are still in it. The Codex, OpenCode and Cursor installers treated that folder as a skill, and the Codex installer even copied the empty folder over the real installed skill, which also stopped its cleanup step from catching it. A folder now counts as a skill only when it has a `SKILL.md`.
- **The Codex installer retires the old `interview` and `pilot` prompts.** 7.0 removed both commands, but 7.1's cleanup only recognised the usual generated prompt, and these two were alias stubs pointing at a different skill. A prompt you wrote yourself is still left alone.
- **memory-migrate keeps every lesson.** Memory files from flow-next before 0.33 put each lesson under a `## <date> manual [<type>]` header with nothing between them, and `memory list-legacy` read each file as one entry. Migration merged the lessons into one entry per file and made an empty entry for a file holding only its header. Each lesson is now its own entry, and `memory list`, `search` and `read` count them the same way. Thanks @TechupBusiness (#509).
- **make-pr accepts Bitbucket pull request links.** A `FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD` that prints a `.../pull-requests/<n>` URL no longer reads as a failed create. Thanks @CWayman (#504).

## [flow-next 7.1.0] - 2026-10-03

7.1 is the release where Flow-Next does what you asked and less of what you didn't. When you're at the keyboard it hands the change back and waits for you to say "open the PR". When you hand it the merge with `--until=merge`, it makes the small, reversible calls itself, writes each one down, and stops before merging if something is really yours to decide. Underneath, most skills now read only the instructions that apply to the run in front of it: a typical attended run reads about a quarter less text than in 7.0 (roughly 19,000 words down to 14,600), and larger features come back a little faster. The rest is a long list of fixes, most of them reported by people running Flow-Next on real work. Thank you.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Flow no longer opens a pull request on an attended run unless you ask for one, and work and plan stop asking setup questions. The plugin's top-level `bin/flowctl` is gone, so a bare `flowctl` typed outside a skill needs its full path (the setup snippet says where); skills are unaffected and nothing needs re-running. RepoPrompt is deprecated and leaves in 8.0.0, and so does the `review.backend` setting: 8.0.0 picks the reviewer from the model-routing block. Codex, OpenCode and Cursor-script installs pick all of this up when you re-run their installer, as usual.

### Changed

- **Attended runs open the pull request when you ask.** A build finishes, commits on a local branch and ends with one line: say "open the PR" when you want it. Nothing is pushed until then. `flow --auto` still stops at an open PR, and a PR a run just opened no longer gets a "land it now?" question.
- **`--until=merge` decides what it can and stops on what it can't.** When you give a run the merge, it makes a call itself if the call is reversible, inside the spec and backed by evidence (updating a snapshot your change legitimately altered, say) and records it in the PR's Decisions list. Anything else, like an irreversible step or a product choice the spec leaves open, stops the run before the merge. Land never marks a draft ready on an unattended merge; it stops and names the open items. You saying "land it" still merges a draft.
- **A reviewer's question no longer ends an unattended run empty-handed.** When the reviewer asks for a human call that doesn't block the rest of the work, the run fixes everything else, opens a draft PR and lists the question as an open item.
- **Work and plan stop asking setup questions.** With no review backend configured, review is off and the handoff says so once. Plan uses its default depth. Set a backend in setup, with `review.backend`, or in the prompt.
- **A check you ask for finishes before the reply.** Ask for the full suite or a command and the run waits for it, instead of handing back while it's still running.
- **Experiments stay read-only on every route.** Running something to settle a question is limited to read-only or throwaway runs. Anything that needs live state, credentials, the network or a destructive command becomes a question when you're there and a human call when you're not.
- **Skills read less.** Text that only matters in some runs (tracker steps, unattended rules, stacked PRs, the no-plan route, feature-map writes and many more) now loads only when the run needs it, and each skill reads the working rules once per run.
- **Flow-Next installs through claude.ai, Cowork and organization sync.** Those surfaces refuse a plugin with a top-level `bin/` directory. The launcher in it was a second copy of `scripts/flowctl`, which every skill already uses. Thanks @sn-furali (#506).
- **Audit's autofix stops at a local branch.** It used to open a pull request on its own; it now commits to `docs/audit-memory-<date>` and tells you the branch.

### Deprecated

- **The `review.backend` setting leaves in 8.0.0.** From 8.0.0 the reviewer is chosen in the model-routing block of your CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, the one setup proposes, the same way implementers and scouts already are. That block lets you name a reviewer model and route review to another model family. Until then `review.backend` keeps working exactly as it does today, and a reviewer named in the prompt still wins.
- **RepoPrompt support leaves in 8.0.0.** That covers the `rp` review backend and `/flow-next:export-context`. Projects already on `rp` keep working until then and get one notice per run. To move off it now, pick another backend (`flowctl config set review.backend codex`, or `host`, `claude`, `copilot`, `cursor`); in 8.0.0 the routing block takes over.

### Fixed

- **Review ran on repos that have a reviewer configured.** Work could check the backend from the skill's own folder, read "nothing configured" and quietly skip review. It now resolves the backend per task from the repository root.
- **Reviewer prompts stopped contradicting themselves.** A pre-existing problem that blocks shipping now counts against the change, a requirement left unaddressed blocks at any severity, and completion review grades the finished build instead of using plan review's scale.
- **A one-task build with a skipped review skips completion review too**, instead of running a full review on a change the risk rule said needed none.
- **Land merges a pull request opened without a spec**, through the same gates as any other.
- **Land's repairs can push.** It fixes review threads and red CI in a detached worktree at the PR head and pushes to the branch by name; resolve-pr does the same when detached.
- **An unattended merge stops once when a review thread needs you**, instead of retrying the same thread every 30 minutes.
- **An attended flow run commits QA's verdict** on the spec branch. Running `/flow-next:qa` yourself still leaves commits to you.
- **Upgrading Codex clears out skills a release removed.** `install-codex.sh` moves any flow-next skill or prompt the release no longer ships into `~/.codex/.flow-next-retired/`. Your own files are untouched.
- **`flowctl show` keeps a spec's tracker link.** It had been dropping the whole `tracker` key, so link checks reported a correct link as missing. Thanks @sn-furali for the report and the fix (#484, #483).
- **A second GitHub blocker no longer stops tracker sync.** GitHub allows one parent per sub-issue; the second edge is now queued for you and the rest of the sync runs. Thanks @TechupBusiness (#502).
- **Tracker pulls stop duplicating comments** in the spec's Sync Log and on the tracker.
- **A spec-only PR carrying old render files isn't counted as shipped work** by the tracker. Thanks @sn-furali (#501).
- **Worktree Kit works from inside a worktree.** Thanks @sn-furali (#469).
- **A formatter's blank line no longer marks your setup block as customized** (#481).
- **Codex setup keeps your edited agent files.** It adds missing ones and asks once about any that differ.
- **Memory migration keeps lessons it didn't migrate**, instead of moving the whole file into the ignored `_migrated/` folder.
- **Prospect promotes the idea you picked.** The `extend` option, which never worked, is gone.
- **Prime asks before creating CI or devcontainer files, and never runs a full suite to assess.**
- **Drive only closes apps it opened.**
- **A reviewer's `NEEDS_HUMAN` stops on every backend**, not just Codex.
- **Smaller fixes:** refine splits only spec inputs; the worker reads design context under a `###` heading; capture writes a requirement-coverage table only on a planned route; the judge refuses an `https://` proxy instead of silently using port 80; QA infers its first viewport instead of asking; refine stops asking "Mark ready?" when flow started it.

## [flow-next 7.0.0] - 2026-10-01

**7.0.0, codename Roadrunner. Flow-Next is now blazing fast.**

A large feature now lands in about half the time your coding agent takes on its own, with a spec, tests, a cross-model review and a pull request that shows its reasoning. On the actual work Flow-Next is as fast as plain Claude Code, or your harness, or faster, and I measured that over and over: the change comes back to you in about the time your agent alone takes, often less. The result is better than the plain agent's even before any review. The optional stages, a cross-model review and live QA where there's a UI, widen the gap to up to 25% better outcomes, especially on large and long-horizon work, and `/flow-next:flow` adds a stage only where the risk calls for it. Run it unattended and it finishes on its own: it never stops to ask, keeps fixing until a reviewer from another model family signs off, and writes every decision it made on your behalf into the pull request.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Ralph is gone: `/flow-next:flow --auto` is the one unattended mode. If you still run Ralph, pin flow-next 6.7.x. Otherwise delete `scripts/ralph/` and any `ralph-guard` hook entries from your project settings, and use `/flow-next:flow --auto` for unattended runs. The HTML render lenses are gone too (run `/flow-next:visual`, or ask for an HTML page). `pipeline.chainStages` is retired and ignored. Unattended merges wait 10 minutes after the last push instead of 30. You don't need to re-run setup.

### How it got here

Flow-Next started on December 26, 2025, as a plugin called flow: a plan command, a few scouts and a quality auditor. Claude Opus 4.5 was the model of the day, and models have come a long way since. It began as a simple way to plan a change and keep the tasks straight. It was the first to run autonomous cross-model review loops, where a model from another family argues with your agent's work until it holds up, and one of the first to interview you before building. It grew from there into the most complete workflow plugin for coding agents that I know of.

The goal was always bigger than a to-do list. I wanted R&D teams to be able to work together on big, messy codebases and get better work out of their agents. Over this year that meant hundreds of features for attended and unattended runs, the building blocks for code factories, and support for six hosts: Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid, Cursor, Grok Build and OpenCode.

None of that ever hurt the quality of the output. It was consistently better than a plain agent's, with bigger gains over the life of a project. But all those features made Flow-Next slower, heavier and hungrier for tokens than I liked. Models and harnesses have also moved on a lot since December. So for 7.0 I went back through the whole plugin and rebuilt it for speed, measuring every change against plain Claude Code before keeping it.

### Benchmarks

I tested 7.0 against plain Claude Code on the same model across a wide spread of work: a simple bug, a hard bug, a small feature and a large feature, attended and unattended, plus a held-out large feature from a repository and stack the tuning never touched. That came to more than 170 full end-to-end runs, each case drawn several times, never a single lucky run. Hidden tests the agent never sees check each result, and a blind judge scores the handoff.

| Task | Speed on the work | Quality | What the quality stages did |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large feature | **up to 1.9x** faster than the default harness | **+25%** | Three cross-model reviewers. Plain Claude Code shipped a data-integrity bug in every run. Flow-Next's reviewers caught it every time, before the pull request. |
| Held-out large feature (Rust) | **1.2x** faster | **+48%** | Three reviewers, then the repo's full test suite. Four real bugs fixed, including a race condition. Flow-Next passed every hidden test; plain Claude Code failed one run in three. |
| Hard bug | **about 2x** faster | **+9%** | Three cross-model reviewers. Found the real cause and fixed it there, instead of loosening the flaky test. |
| Simple bug | **1.2x** faster | **+10%** | No review: a small, local fix. Better even without review: a failing test first, a fix at the cause, then a check that it works for the user. |
| Small feature | **1.1-1.3x** faster | **+8%** | One cross-model reviewer. The reviewer caught a setup check the new option broke. Fixed before handoff. |

Speed is time to the working change against the default harness (plain Claude Code, or yours) on the same model, before any review or QA. Quality is the blind-judged result.

Run unattended with `--until=merge`, a large feature and a hard bug both went from spec to a merged pull request with nobody watching and no stops, **the large feature in about half the time plain Claude Code took**.

I'm going to keep improving Flow-Next, both what it does and how fast it does it.

### Removed

- **Ralph.** `/flow-next:ralph-init`, the `scripts/ralph/` harness and `ralphctl`, the `ralph-guard` hooks, setup's Ralph question, the `FLOW_RALPH`, `RALPH_ITERATION` and `FLOW_RALPH_NO_TRIAGE` variables, the Ralph-run probe in `flowctl status`, and the `flow-next-tui` run monitor.
- **The HTML render lenses.** I removed the opt-in HTML pages that capture, plan and make-pr wrote under `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/`, along with the `artifacts.html.enabled` key, setup's HTML question and `flowctl pr-cognitive-aid html-input`. People turned them on and then every capture, plan and make-pr run got much slower, and I saw little benefit in return. For a visual view of a spec, a plan or a diff, run `/flow-next:visual`, or ask the agent for an HTML page when you want one. A config that still sets `artifacts.html.enabled` keeps working. flowctl ignores the key and prints a one-line note. Your old `spec.html` and `pr.html` files stay where they are and you can delete them, along with the `HTML render lens:` link line a lens added near the top of each spec.
- **The pilot and interview skill stubs.** The hidden `flow-next-pilot` and `flow-next-interview` skills that kept the old names working are gone. Use `/flow-next:flow --auto` and `/flow-next:refine`.
- **`pipeline.chainStages`.** I removed the key along with the pilot alias, as the deprecation note said I would. It only made `flow --auto --tick` open the PR in the same tick as a fresh QA verdict, and a long-horizon `flow --auto` already runs QA and then make-pr as consecutive hops. Under `--tick`, make-pr now runs on the next tick. You don't need to do anything else. Remove the key from `.flow/config.json`. Until you do, flowctl ignores it and prints a one-line note.
- **The Codex hooks switch.** `install-codex.sh` no longer adds `hooks = true` to `~/.codex/config.toml`: it was there only for Ralph's guard hook. A `hooks` line already in your config stays, so your own hooks keep working, and an old `codex_hooks` line is renamed to `hooks` with its value kept.

### Changed

- **Faster routing, fewer questions.** `/flow-next:flow` picks the route itself in seconds, from your words and the repository, and no longer asks about a branch or a readiness flag before building: it takes the sensible default and says so in one line. `/flow-next:work` run on its own no longer asks the branch question either. A small, local change goes straight to the change with no spec.
- **A spec with one task is built right in the conversation.** Workers and the multi-task scheduler run only when a spec has several tasks, or when you route a task to a chosen model.
- **Review by risk.** A change that touches persisted or shared state, concurrency, security, data layout or migrations, or spans several files, gets three reviewers from another model family. A small local fix gets one, and a change to output, wording or display gets none, with the reason recorded.
- **One review, one look at the fixes, when you're there.** You get the result first; the review runs in the background, and after the fixes the same reviewer looks only at what changed. Findings the author declines are listed with a reason in the fix commit, and the reviewer can withdraw them. If the re-review still finds a problem, you get the findings with the reviewer's reasons and decide: fix more, or accept the change as is. Plan review and completion review work the same way when you're there: one fix pass and one re-review, where they used to loop to the round cap.
- **Reviewers block only on what shows the change wrong.** A blocking finding needs a concrete failing scenario, minor findings never block, and overengineering is flagged only inside the change under review.
- **Unattended runs keep going until the reviewer signs off.** `flow --auto` loops fix and re-review until SHIP. The author may decline hardening, scope creep and problems that predate the change; if that's all the reviewer has left, all below Major, the loop ends and each disagreement goes into the pull request, both sides with their reasons. A finding that shows a stated requirement broken is always fixed. Plan review and completion review loop the same way when unattended.
- **Unattended runs finish with something you can review.** They never ask. Every default they pick, finding they decline and review they skip goes into a Decisions list in the pull request. A call only you can make, and that blocks nothing else, goes in as an open item on a draft pull request instead of stopping the run.
- **Pull requests open ready** unless there are open items (a spec question, unfinished work, an open QA finding, or a call left for you), which open it as a draft. A route without a spec can open one directly, drafted the same way.
- **Working rules shared by every stage.** One reference sets the scope (the smallest change the evidence justifies, including a sibling case the same cause breaks in the same code), the tests (focused tests for what changed, the full suite only when your repository or you ask, a check you name always run and waited for, a slow run's full output kept in a file), a user-level check before handing back (the change run the way a user meets it, including each error case and boundary the request names, or its tests when it has no user-facing entry), the handoff (each claim marked measured, inferred or a guess) and follow-ups as plain facts.
- **Lighter refine (interview), plan and QA.** Refine (the former interview) asks only what would change the build, in one question pass. Plan and QA read far less before they start: each loads only the steps its run needs. Capture and refine tag only what they paraphrased or inferred; your own words stay untagged.
- **Unattended merges wait 10 minutes, not 30.** When `--until=merge` lands a pull request without you authorizing the merge in the session, land waits `land.patienceMinutes` after the last push so review bots can post. That window is for bots, not people: if you expect a human review you would not run `--until=merge`. Bots post within a few minutes and the wait overlaps CI, so I cut the default to 10. Set `land.patienceMinutes` if your bots are slower.
- **The optional Jev judge no longer picks the route.** With a key, Jev's route answers sent small features down heavier routes than the same request took without one, and routing was no faster for it: the agent picks a route in seconds on its own. Routing is now the agent's and the code's, with or without a key.
- **The optional Jev judge no longer decides whether QA runs.** Under `pipeline.qa=auto`, the agent judges whether the acceptance is UI-observable, as keyless runs always did, and code still finds the startable target. The Jev call added a few seconds and never changed the outcome, so I removed it. The stage lines are `stage: qa - ran [target: <cmd>]` and `stage: qa - skipped(config: pipeline.qa=auto: <reason>)`.
- **Memory reads the same way with or without a key.** Plan and workers run one `memory search "<task sentence>" --limit 15 --rerank --json` and pick the entries that apply from their titles and snippets. With a key, Jev reorders those hits and drops none; before, its relevance floor could return nothing for a real query. Plan no longer spawns the memory scout to refine a keyless search.
- **Keyless runs skip calls that cannot answer.** `/flow-next:flow` checks once per run, prints `judge: off`, and makes no fork-gate call. A spec's route call runs either way, because its lifecycle and QA target are decided in code. Jev now only hints at fork kind, reorders memory hits and picks a task tier.
- **A fork you find is never cancelled by the judge.** The fork gate no longer reuses route answers computed on the spec text; you classify your own fork, and an optional hint on your fork sentence never removes it.
- **Under the hood.** `flowctl judge --preset route` is lifecycle-only and sends no request, key or no key; the intake `intent`/`brief` views, the kind Choice and every route Noul are gone, and so is `judge --explain`. The `qa-gate` preset and its UI Noul are gone; the QA gate reads the target from the route result's `startable_target_fact`. The memory rerank no longer sends entry paths or BM25 scores, and its score levels describe situations. The `fork-gate` preset asks only the fork-kind Choice. The memory stage line reads `memory: reranked (jev, <n> entries)`.

### Fixed

- **A spec flow just captured goes straight to the build.** Flow's route check looked at readiness before the route capture recorded, so every freshly captured spec came back "not ready" and the agent had to reason its way to the build. The recorded route now wins; `--auto` still builds only ready specs.
- **A pull request opened without a spec carries the change.** When you ask for a PR on a direct change that isn't committed yet, make-pr commits it (only the files you changed) before pushing. `--dry-run` prints the body and touches nothing.
- **Tracker updates fire from a one-task build.** The single-task path checked whether a tracker is connected but never kept the answer its tracker steps read, so lifecycle updates could misfire on a connected repo.
- **Deep review passes run under zsh.** The loop over selected passes sent them as one value in zsh, the default shell on macOS.
- **The Copilot reviewer is read-only now.** It ran with `--allow-all-tools`, which Copilot needs for a non-interactive run, and that also let it edit files and run any shell command in your checkout. The reviewer and the Copilot triage judge now run with `--deny-tool write --deny-tool shell`, the same read-only tools the Claude reviewer gets.
- **The optional Jev judge works behind a proxy.** Keyed judge calls ignored `HTTPS_PROXY`, so behind a corporate proxy, or in a sandbox whose only way out is one, every call failed and the run quietly fell back to no Jev. They now go through `HTTPS_PROXY` and respect `NO_PROXY`, including entries with a port.

## [flow-next 6.7.0] - 2026-09-29

Codex reviews and the Codex agents now run on GPT-6.1 Sol, the model Codex lists first as of 2026-09-29, and the Claude review backend can fall back to Opus 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5 before reaching the older models.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Re-run `./scripts/install-codex.sh` so your generated Codex agents move to `gpt-6.1-sol`. An account that cannot serve it steps down to `gpt-6-astra`, then `gpt-6-sol`. A model you name explicitly still wins. No setup re-run is needed.

### Changed

- **Codex reviews and the generated Codex agents run on GPT-6.1 Sol.** Reviews through the Codex backend now default to `gpt-6.1-sol` at high effort, stepping down to `gpt-6-astra` and then `gpt-6-sol` when an account cannot serve it. The generated Codex scouts, flow-gap-analyst, plan-sync and quality-auditor move from `gpt-6-sol` to `gpt-6.1-sol` at the same efforts; re-run `./scripts/install-codex.sh` to pick them up. The Claude review backend now steps down from Fable 5.1 through Opus 5.5, Opus 5, Sonnet 5.5 and Sonnet 5; a Claude Code older than 2.1.284 does not recognize the 5.5 ids and steps past them. A model you name explicitly still wins.

## [flow-next 6.6.0] - 2026-09-28

Plan, prime and the other scout-heavy steps get faster and cheaper: the bundled scouts now run on Sonnet 5.5, which Anthropic reports at more than 30% faster than Sonnet 5 and lower cost than Opus 5.5, scoring within about three points of Opus 5.5 on its published agentic-coding and knowledge-work benchmarks. Teams that keep `.flow/` in a planning repo and their product code in sibling clones get the full gates whenever that code changes, and the feature map ages from product commits instead of planning edits. A feature-map maintain pass now finishes on repos whose branch and commit names need a ticket key or whose host is not GitHub, and a failed push keeps the proven corrections instead of discarding them. make-pr opens its pull request from zsh as well as bash.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Update Claude Code to 2.1.284 or later so the `sonnet` alias means Sonnet 5.5; an older Claude Code runs the scouts on Sonnet 5. In a home-base workspace, name the sibling code repos in your project instructions so work and the feature-map commands find them. No setup re-run is needed.

### Changed

- **Scouts run on Sonnet 5.5 instead of Opus.** 6.4.0 moved the bundled scouts, flow-gap-analyst and plan-sync from Haiku and Sonnet to Opus as a stopgap until a stronger Sonnet shipped. Sonnet 5.5 scores close to Opus 5.5 on agentic coding and knowledge-work benchmarks, runs more than 30% faster and costs less, so those agents now pin `sonnet`. Scout-heavy steps such as plan and prime get cheaper and faster. quality-auditor stays on Opus, and the worker and PR comment resolver still inherit the session model. The `sonnet` alias resolves to Sonnet 5.5 from Claude Code 2.1.284; older versions resolve it to Sonnet 5, so update Claude Code. The generated Codex agents are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **make-pr opens the pull request from a zsh shell.** make-pr runs its create step in the agent's own shell, and on zsh (the macOS default) the default create command failed with `command not found: gh pr create`, because zsh does not split an unquoted variable into words. The create command now runs through `sh -c`, so it works from bash and zsh alike and a `FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD` with its own arguments still works.
- **A `/flow-next:features` maintain pass now ships on repos with naming rules or a non-GitHub host, and a failed ship no longer throws away the proven corrections.** The ship step used a fixed branch name and commit message and a bare `gh pr create`, so a repo whose hooks require a ticket key, or one hosted on Bitbucket, could not finish a pass. Any failure there also restored every proven map edit to HEAD. Now maintain reads the repo's branch and commit naming rules at entry and asks then for a value it cannot know, such as a ticket key, before any proof work. It opens the PR through make-pr's `FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD` seam and stops after the push with `CHANGED` when no create command reaches the host. It also honours a request to only commit or to leave the edits uncommitted. A commit, push or PR-create failure after the proofs ends `BLOCKED` with the edits left in place and named. Thanks to @CWayman for the report (#495).
- **Home-base workspaces: a code change in a sibling repo no longer passes as docs-only.** Some teams keep `.flow/` in a planning repo and the product code in sibling clones beside it. Work, the feature-map update and `features status` read only the planning repo, so a spec whose code changed in two siblings could classify as "TIER_B, docs-only" and run lint-only gates, and the feature map never aged from product commits. Now work records each sibling repo's base at branch setup in `.flow/tmp/spec_base_repos`, runs `gate classify` inside each one, and allows the docs-only tier only when every repo qualifies. The feature-map update reads the sibling diffs too. `flowctl features status --repo <path>` (repeatable) adds each sibling's surface commits since the proof date, reports them per repo in `commits_since_by_repo`, and exits `2` for a path that is not a sibling repo root. The siblings come from your project instructions; there is no config key, and a single-repo workspace behaves as before. Thanks to @CWayman for the detailed report (#494).

## [flow-next 6.5.0] - 2026-09-28

Flow now does less before the agent starts and keeps every check after it. Refine asks only the questions whose answers would change what gets built, often none in a codebase whose patterns already answer them, and flow, capture and plan send you there only when such a decision is open. A preference you state stays guidance instead of turning into a hard requirement such as "must load in 20 ms". Refine is also one interview now: name an audience with `--scope=qa`, `--biz` or plain words like "run a business interview", or name none. A hill climb starts from the target you stated, with the agent choosing and recording how it measures. A bug fix no longer stops because other pull requests touch the same files, and live-app stages read the feature map directly. Current models settle most of what these steps used to pin down up front, so the time goes into building and verifying. Implementation review, QA and the evidence in the pull request work exactly as before.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Scripts that call `flowctl scope` (`resolve`, `bank`, `write-policy`) or pass `flowctl done --resolved-feature` need updating, because both are removed. Refine no longer asks which interview to run. Pass a scope or say which audience you want when you want a lens. A repo-root `SPEC.md` copied from an older template keeps working, with its `<!-- scope: ... -->` comments ignored; re-copy the bundled template and re-apply your edits to pick up the cleaner version. You don't need to re-run setup.

### Changed

- **A hill climb no longer needs a filled-in form in the spec; you state the target and the agent sets up the rest.** In 6.4.0 the loop started only when the spec carried a `## Hill-climb pre-registration` section with nine labelled fields, and any missing field stopped the run, so a spec captured from "get cold start under 40 ms, keep trying" stopped before measuring anything. Now the agent picks the measured case, the metric and its direction, a minimum number of attempts, the budget, the runs per measurement and the smallest difference that counts, using your numbers wherever you gave them, and builds and proves the benchmark itself. It writes those choices at the top of the attempt ledger before the first attempt, so they are fixed in advance and visible in the pull request. The only thing that stops the run is a spec with no target: attended, flow asks once; unattended, it stops with `NEEDS_HUMAN`. The target stays yours and is never relaxed. The loop's other rules hold: one change per measurement, an attempt kept as its own commit only past the noise with your tests green, everything else reverted, one ledger row per attempt, and a missed target reported rather than relaxed. A second confirming measurement is no longer required, a simplification that holds the number may be kept, and independent ideas may be tried in parallel worktrees, each measured against the current best. An existing pre-registration section still works: its values are the numbers you gave.
- **Refine asks only what would change the build, and flow sends you there less often.** A refine run used to walk a bank of topics, expect 40 or more questions and always probe performance, concurrency and testing, so a mature project could spend hours answering questions the code already answered, and "should we care about performance?" could come back as a "must load in 20 ms" acceptance criterion. Now a question is asked only when a wrong guess would build the wrong thing, nothing but you can settle it, and it is your call; everything else the agent resolves, records or leaves to implementation. Refine stops when nothing like that is left, and "the spec is clear enough to build" after zero questions is a normal result. Your answers keep the precision you gave them: a preference goes to Decision Context as guidance, and a number becomes an acceptance criterion only when you stated it. Refine reads `STRATEGY.md` and searches the other project docs for what the spec touches instead of reading the README and changelog in full.

  Flow, capture and plan now recommend refine only when an open product or authority decision can be named, and a technical question only for a costly-to-reverse technical fork the code does not answer, such as a data model, a public contract or a security boundary. A structured brief no longer defaults into refine. Prospect points survivors and promoted ideas at `/flow-next:flow <id>` so the router picks the next step. Removed: capture's "consider `/flow-next:refine --scope=business`" footer line, the recommendation of a technical pass just because technical sections are empty, the `*Pending technical-scope interview pass.*` placeholder a business pass wrote under empty technical sections, and the `placeholder_write` key and `tech_sections_have_content` input of `flowctl scope write-policy`.
- **Refine is one interview, and `--scope` is a free-text lens.** Refine used to ask which of three interviews to run (business, technical or both), then kept each pass to its own sections with a write policy. Now it runs one interview that asks whatever open decision would change the build and writes each answer into the section it belongs in. `--scope=<anything>` focuses the questions on one audience's decisions, including audiences refine never defined, such as `--scope=qa` or `--scope=security`; `--biz` and `--tech` still work, and with no scope nothing is asked up front. Sections no answer belongs in come back byte-for-byte, and the read-back names every section the session changed, so a product owner and a tech lead refining the same spec in separate sessions still see any change outside their layer. `--scope=research` is unchanged. Specs with the old layout (`<!-- scope: ... -->` comments, `### Motivation` / `### Implementation Tradeoffs` under Decision Context) load and refine as they are. Removed: the scope question, the two-phase `--scope=both` run, the `flowctl scope` command group (`resolve`, `bank`, `write-policy`), the per-scope question banks, and the scope-owner comments and two-shape Decision Context note in the bundled spec template. A repo-root `SPEC.md` copied from the old template keeps working; its scope comments are now ignored.
- **A bug fix no longer stops because other pull requests touch the same files.** The defect route's prior-fix check used to stop and list them whenever several open pull requests touched the affected area, which on a busy file meant `NEEDS_HUMAN` for every unattended fix. Now the agent records those pull requests in the done summary and continues. It still stops when one of them already fixes the bug, or when a person visibly owns a fix in progress. The reproduction step now asks for a reproduction that fires reliably instead of a fixed "reproduce twice".
- **Live-app stages find the feature on the map themselves; the resolved-feature record is gone.** Flow's bug intake, work's live proof and measurements, and QA each read the map index and the one matching feature file before driving, as they did before. They no longer pass the match along as a record, because reading the map costs a few turns at most. Removed: `flowctl done --resolved-feature` (passing it now fails as an unrecognized argument), the QA receipt's `resolved_feature` field, the rule for which stage's record wins, the intake step that confirmed the spec showed the record, and the PR briefing's `Resolved feature` cell. Existing task evidence and QA payloads that carry `resolved_feature` still load; the key is ignored. Feature files, drift notes, `flowctl features status` and `/flow-next:features` are unchanged.

## [flow-next 6.4.0] - 2026-09-28

Asking flow to move one number toward a target now runs a measured loop: each idea is benchmarked against the noise, kept as its own commit only when it wins and your tests stay green, and reverted otherwise, and the pull request shows every attempt. On a fixture CLI, five attempts cut `--version` cold start from 124 ms to 8 ms. Refine now settles factual questions, such as how long something takes, whether a layout fits or whether a parser accepts an input, by running a throwaway experiment and recording what it saw, so fewer questions reach you. Flow's prototypes put competing ideas behind one switcher, and Codex reviews keep the model they started with through every re-review.

**What changes when you upgrade.** The bundled scouts run on Opus instead of Haiku and Sonnet, so scout-heavy steps such as plan and prime cost more per run; name a cheaper model on the `fast scout` and `thinking scout` lines of your routing block to trade that back. The generated Codex agents move to the gpt-6 models. No setup re-run is needed.

### Added

- **Asking flow to move one number toward a target now runs a measured improvement loop, not a single change.** Work proves your benchmark can tell better from worse before trusting it, then tries one idea at a time: an idea is kept, as its own commit, only when it beats the best so far by more than the noise, a second measurement agrees and your regression tests stay green; everything else is reverted. The run stops on the target and a minimum number of attempts, or on the budget you set, and a missed target is reported, never relaxed. The PR shows the baseline and final values, every attempt including the reverted ones, and the best idea not yet tried. On a fixture CLI, five attempts cut `--version` cold start from 124 ms to 8 ms, with three kept, one reverted and one inconclusive. You write the metric, target and budget in a `## Hill-climb pre-registration` section of the spec.

### Changed

- **Refine answers factual questions by running something instead of asking you.** Whether a parser accepts an input, how long a query takes, whether a layout fits at 320 px, whether an eval separates two variants: refine runs a throwaway experiment and records the question, what ran, what it observed, and the decision under a new `## Resolved via Experiment` section. An experiment that would touch live state, credentials or the network becomes a question, and so does a result too noisy to decide; you get the data with it. Product and preference calls still come to you.
- **Flow's prototypes compare competing ideas side by side.** When a design fork has more than one viable answer, the prototype builds the variants behind one labelled switcher, so you compare them in one place. When the options are still open, flow first gathers prior art and lets you pick a direction. A prototype stays evidence and is never shipped.
- **Every bundled scout now runs on Opus.** The prime pillar scanners and memory-scout were pinned to Haiku, and the planning scouts, the gap analyst and plan-sync to Sonnet; all of them now pin `opus`, which follows the current Opus release. They pin Opus rather than following your session model, so planning on a pricier model does not make every scout fan-out run on it too. Opus scouts cost more than the old pins; to trade that back, name a cheaper model on your routing block's `fast scout` / `thinking scout` lines. The worker and the PR comment resolver still follow your session model.
- **The Codex mirror moves to the gpt-6 models.** The generated Codex agents map to `gpt-6-sol` (was `gpt-5.6-terra`) and the fast baseline is `gpt-6-luna` (was `gpt-5.6-luna`); set `CODEX_MODEL_INTELLIGENT` / `CODEX_MODEL_FAST` at sync time to choose others. The codex review backend's triage judge defaults to `gpt-6-luna`, and when `gpt-6-astra` is withheld the codex reviewer now steps down to `gpt-6-sol` before older models. The copilot triage judge stays on `claude-haiku-4.5`.

### Fixed

- **Codex re-reviews, validator passes and deep passes run on the model the review started with.** Since codex-cli 0.154 a resumed Codex session runs the model in your Codex config rather than the one the review dispatched, so a review pinned to one model re-reviewed on another while its receipt still named the pin. The resume now re-pins the model the prior receipt records, whether you named it or the fallback ladder picked it; a receipt with no known model resumes as before. Reported by @TechupBusiness in #486.

## [flow-next 6.3.0] - 2026-09-27

Bug fixes now come with their cause and their proof, and every stage that drives your running app starts from the feature map. Before writing a fix, flow checks whether someone already fixed or is fixing the bug, confirms the cause with runtime evidence, and bisects to the change that introduced it when a known-good revision exists. The fix is proven by the same reproduction failing on the base and passing on the head. Performance baselines, QA, bug-fix proofs and PR live checks read the map before driving. On one fixture app with one model, tasks that did not say where their target was took about 40% fewer turns and a third to half less wall time, with success no lower.

The pull request briefing now lists the prior-fix findings, the confirmed cause, the introducing commit, the base and head results, and the feature the live checks used. A step that did not run is listed as not done, with its reason.

What you keep: bug intake keeps the map rule it shipped with in 6.2.0, routes that never drive an app never read the map, and a repository without a map pays one existence check. No setup re-run is needed.

### Changed

- **Bug fixes check for prior work, confirm the cause with runtime evidence, bisect when they can, and prove the fix on base and head.** An existing fix is verified instead of duplicated, and a fix someone else owns is handed back. The same reproduction must fail on the base and pass on the head, on the live app when there is one. The task record and the PR briefing carry the findings, including any step that was not done.
- **Every flow stage that drives your running app now starts from the feature map.** Performance baselines and post-change measurements, bug-fix proofs on base and head, QA, and live checks reported in PRs read the index and the one matching feature file, including its notes on controls that misbehave. Later stages reuse the matched feature, and the PR briefing shows it or `unmapped`. On a fixture app (66 runs, same model), tasks that did not locate their target took about 40% fewer turns, and a task that named the page paid 0 to 3 extra turns.

### Under the hood

- The defect route's steps live in `flow-next-work/references/defect-route.md`, loaded only for reported-defect tasks; the routing row and the judge's defect wording name the four steps.
- The live-app rule is one section of the feature-entry contract. `flowctl qa receipt` accepts an optional `resolved_feature`, validated like `flowctl done --resolved-feature`; a stage reuses the first current record on the spec and re-resolves when the feature file, its sub-feature or its last-proven line changed.

## [flow-next 6.2.0] - 2026-09-27

Your feature map now keeps itself current, and bug reports that don't say where the problem is start from it. A spec that renames a button or moves a page updates the map in the same pull request, so the map no longer goes stale between manual refreshes. Hand flow an untitled screenshot or a vague "this thing in my list" and it goes straight to the matching feature instead of searching the app. On a fixture app it ended the long searches on the hardest report, an untitled screenshot, cutting its turns from 38 to about 12 (48 runs, same model), with every defect reproduced and cost unchanged.

Keeping the map current is now a side effect of normal work. Work updates the entries its own change altered and proves each new route with one live drive. Every stage that drives from the map reports a route that no longer matches, and a later proof closes that report. Flow tells you when the map is due a full maintain pass; it recommends the pass and never runs it. Setup and prime recommend seeding a map on every run, whether or not live QA is on.

What you keep: `/flow-next:features` stays the only command that seeds or fully maintains the map, and it only runs when you invoke it. A repo without a map pays one existence check. Existing maps stay valid as they are.

### Added

- **Work keeps the feature map current as part of the change.** When a spec changes how a user reaches a mapped feature (a renamed button, a moved page, a removed sub-feature), work updates only those feature files, proves each new route with one live drive, and ships the map diff beside the code diff. If the app cannot start, or the change cannot be tied to one file, work leaves the map alone and files a drift note for the next maintain pass instead of guessing.
- **Bug reports that don't say where start from the feature map.** When flow gets a bug report, console output or a screenshot that still needs a reproduction, and the report does not locate itself (an untitled screenshot, "this thing in my list"), flow matches it to one mapped feature, using what a screenshot shows as well as its text, and drives the reproduction along that feature's route. A report that names the page or control goes there directly, as before, and falls back to the map only if that lookup fails. No match falls back to live discovery; a stale route files a drift note; flow never edits the map. On a fixture app (six reported defects, 48 runs, same model) the map cut the hardest untitled screenshot from 38 turns to about 12 and left the other one unchanged, with every defect reproduced in both arms at flat cost and wall time. The matched feature is recorded with the fix, so QA and the PR briefing start from it.
- **Flow tells you when the map needs a maintain pass.** With no argument, `/flow-next:flow` prints `Also recommended: /flow-next:features` when a drift note is open or a feature was last proven 50 or more code-changing commits ago on the default branch. Change the threshold with `flowctl config set features.staleAfterCommits <n>`.
- **Feature files record when they were last proven.** Seed, maintain and work write a `**Last proven:** <date> at <short commit>` line under `**Surface:**`. Files without the line read as never proven, so the first due report asks for one maintain pass.

### Changed

- **Setup and prime always recommend the feature map.** Setup prints the `/flow-next:features` line on every run, not only when live QA is on: seed when no map exists, maintain when one is due. Prime's report carries the same line beside its QA-readiness line.
- **Drift notes close when a route is re-proven.** A maintain pass or work update that proves the route a drift note names marks the note stale, so the open count means open drift. A route that drifts again reopens its note. Drive now files the same note as QA when a mapped route no longer matches the live app.

### Under the hood

- `flowctl features status [--json]` reports each feature file's last-proven line, its age in code-changing default-branch commits, the open `feature-map-drift` notes and a seed, maintain or none recommendation.
- `flowctl done --resolved-feature <json|unmapped>` records the matched feature (`surface`, `sub_feature`, `file`, `last_proven`, `stage`) in the task's done evidence; `spec export-cognitive-aid` surfaces it only when present, so existing exports are unchanged.
- New config key `features.staleAfterCommits` (default 50).

## [flow-next 6.1.1] - 2026-09-26

The Flow-Next block that setup writes into CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md now points agents at the prose skill they can actually call, and plan dispatches its scouts one step faster.

**What changes when you upgrade.** Re-run `/flow-next:setup` once in each repository that has a Flow-Next block in its CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md. The block's version moves to 3, and setup offers the refresh. The refreshed block tells the agent to apply the prose contract through the skill id (`flow-next:flow-next-prose`); the old block's `/flow-next:prose` line stopped working in 6.1.0, when commands became typed-only.

### Fixed

- **The setup block's prose reminder works again.** 6.1.0 made `/flow-next:*` commands typed-only, so the old block's instruction to invoke `/flow-next:prose` pointed the agent at a command it can no longer call. The setup snippet now names the skill id and its schema version is 3, which re-arms setup's one consented refresh per repository.
- **`pipeline.chainStages` is documented as deprecated, not removed.** The key still works under `flow --auto --tick`; the config schema and the flowctl reference no longer say it goes in the release after pilot's alias.

### Changed

- **Plan no longer runs the tier judge before each scout.** Plan scouts already have fixed tiers: memory-scout is the only fast scout and every other scout runs as a thinking scout, so the per-scout judge call cost a step and decided nothing. Work still runs the judge for task dispatches.

## [flow-next 6.1.0] - 2026-09-26

Unattended runs now stop where they used to guess. `flow --auto` keeps the spec you
named, honours per-task review routing, stops on blocked work instead of retrying it,
and refuses a review receipt whose verdict contradicts the review it records. Every
guard it runs fails closed when its evidence is missing. A typo in `.flow/config.json`
no longer resets your settings to defaults.

Agents load less and hand-assemble less. A worker's anchor bundle drops from about
160 KB to about 60 KB per task with no loss on the comprehension eval (7 of 7 on three
task sets, both bundles). Every session's skill listing shows each skill once instead
of twice. Receipts, prompts, tracker bodies, QA and prospect artifacts are rendered by
flowctl, so skills write only the judgment.

**What changes when you upgrade.** The `/flow-next:pilot` and `/flow-next:interview`
command shims are removed; use `/flow-next:flow --auto --tick` and
`/flow-next:refine`. Command shims are now typed-only, so an agent invokes skills by id
(`flow-next:flow-next-<name>`). `flowctl show <spec> --json` no longer includes the
`review_attempts` and `tracker` ledgers; read them with `flowctl review-rounds attempts`
and `flowctl sync get-state`. A body-writing tracker push refuses to overwrite a
tracker body someone edited since the last sync: an attended run asks whether to
reconcile or overwrite, and an unattended run defers the decision.

### Changed

- **Skills hand flowctl their judgments and receive rendered artifacts.** New helpers write prospect artifacts and QA receipts, apply memory audit plans, render host review prompts and tracker bodies, and prepare tracker snapshots. Bulk task creation reports all invalid items together and accepts per-task source files and Touches. Existing explicit inputs remain supported.
- **Workflow state takes fewer calls.** Pilot, planning and setup snapshots gather their mechanical checks together. Rolling admission reports capacity, dependency and file-overlap holds; contiguous task completion derives commit evidence from a range. Setup remembers declined optional questions. Make-pr and map run their shell plumbing from bundled scripts.
- **Workers and skills read less output.** The worker anchor bundle carries the text memory index, only the glossary entries its task names, and short git status, cutting a typical bundle from about 160 KB to about 60 KB with no comprehension loss on the fn-83 eval. `flowctl show <spec> --json` no longer includes the `review_attempts` and `tracker` ledgers; read them with `flowctl review-rounds attempts` and `flowctl sync get-state`. `flowctl glossary list --match "<text>"` returns only the entries that text names. Review workflows print only the recorded fields they use, and the tracker-sync references drop steps the tracker facade already performs.
- **Command shims are user-only.** Every `/flow-next:*` command carries `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the agent's skill listing shows each skill once; skills and agents invoke each other by skill id (`flow-next:flow-next-<name>`). Typed slash commands work as before.

### Fixed

- **Unattended runs preserve their scope and stop on blocked work.** Tracker-key specs resolve through the same lookup as other commands, review overrides stay explicit, and branch setup uses the resolved default base and stops on git failures.
- **Review receipts agree with the recorded review.** Contradictory verdicts and counts are refused, open reviews survive trivial-diff triage, concurrent spec updates retain review rounds, and interrupted fan-out can recover completed draws.
- **Worker handovers stay separate across concurrent tasks.** The conductor supplies task-unique paths and integrated review bases, captures lessons after a NEEDS_WORK-to-SHIP recovery, and passes readable inputs to plan-sync.
- **Invalid configuration and tracker co-edits remain intact.** Configuration writes refuse unreadable or malformed files; a body-writing tracker push that finds the tracker body edited since the last sync returns `tracker_diverged`; an attended run asks whether to reconcile or overwrite (`--overwrite-diverged`), and an unattended run defers the decision with `flowctl sync defer`. Ralph checks shell commands and redirect targets without blocking harmless mentions, and keeps worker completion evidence mandatory.
- **Review commands need fewer arguments.** Plan review runs without a `--files` list, impl review resolves an omitted `--base` to the repository's default branch, and plan and completion receipts default to the checkout's `.flow/tmp/` so two repos never share one. Host impl review also runs a standalone review with no task id.
- **`flowctl done` checks its evidence and records the plan-sync skip itself.** Evidence without `commits`, `tests` or `prs` is refused, unknown keys print a warning, `done` and `block` check status under the task lock, and with plan-sync off the receipt carries its `stage: plan-sync - skipped(...)` line without a hand edit. Error hints name `flowctl start <id>` before `--force`, and output piped into `head` no longer ends in a traceback.
- **Skills read what flowctl actually writes.** Capture writes a spec in one atomic call and checks duplicates against open specs only; plan seeds new specs from the template; prospect's snippets run without PyYAML or `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; memory-migrate reads `entry_id`; audit stamps keep fields outside the schema; setup stays within the question tool's limits; prime keys scout findings to its criterion IDs; and shipped links resolve in an installed plugin.

### Removed

- **The `/flow-next:pilot` and `/flow-next:interview` command shims.** Use `/flow-next:flow --auto --tick` and `/flow-next:refine`. The skill stubs are hidden and forward to the new names; they go in a later release.

## [flow-next 6.0.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A tracker-first spec is linked the moment it is minted.** `flowctl spec create --tracker-first` now takes `--tracker-id` and `--tracker-url` beside `--tracker-identifier`, and writes the durable id, display key, URL and `linkState: linked` in the same write. Before, the mint stored only the display key, so a later lifecycle touchpoint could treat the spec as unlinked and open a second issue. A durable id already linked to another spec refuses the mint. The plan, capture, work, refine and QA mint sites now read or create the issue first and pass its identity at mint. Thanks to @sn-furali for the report in #464.

## [flow-next 6.0.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Jira issues now render the way the spec reads.** Headings, bold, lists, code blocks and tables pushed through tracker-sync now show up formatted in Jira, not as `#` headings turned into numbered lists and `**bold**` left as stray asterisks. A Jira REST v2 text field holds wiki markup and never interprets Markdown, so flowctl now converts issue and comment bodies to wiki markup before every write and decodes them back to Markdown once on read, so merge bases, the echo fence, and comment dedup keep comparing Markdown. Correct display needs the Wiki Style Renderer on the description and comment fields; the Default Text Renderer shows the markup literally. An issue pushed before this change is converted by its next push or reconcile while its body is unchanged since the last sync; a pull refuses it with a `jira_body_unconverted` conflict until then. Thanks to @flecamos for the report and the diagnosis in #465.

## [flow-next 6.0.0] - 2026-09-21

A pull request from flow-next now reads like a briefing for the person reviewing
it, and make-pr produces it 60% faster. The body opens with why the change
exists, then walks the review in order: each step says what to check and lists
up to ten files that must be read, each a link with its purpose and the
requirement it serves. Everything else is counted in one line. Verification is
a checklist that ticks only what passed.

On a fixed 23-file pull request the median make-pr run went from 251 seconds to
100, from 22 tool calls to 13, and from 21,627 output tokens to 8,174 (three
cold runs per point). The agent now writes only judgment, flowctl fills in the
rest of the diff, and an ordinary run loads under 600 lines of instructions
where it loaded about 2,900.

Landing is a loop you can read in five minutes. Name one pull request:
`/flow-next:land <PR>` resolves its review threads, fixes CI once, catches the
branch up, and merges when you authorized the merge in the session. Land's
instructions went from 1,741 lines to under 200, and it keeps no state between
runs. A finished spec closes on the pull-request branch, so the close reaches a
protected base through the merge itself. A branch that closes several specs
gets one body and lands as one pull request. This release landed itself that
way: 175 files, four specs, one pull request.

**What changes when you upgrade.** This is a **major** release. A bare or
scheduled `/flow-next:land` no longer finds pull requests, so replace it with a
loop over named ones ([recipe](https://flow-next.dev/autonomy/land/#the-land-loop)).
Eight `land.*` keys are retired; they still load, with one notice, and are
ignored. Release-follow, reviewer requests and the merge-command override are
gone, and so is make-pr's `--no-mermaid` flag. The upgrade notes below give the
replacement for each.

### Changed

- **One pull request can carry several finished specs.** An integration branch that closes four specs gets one
  body: a review group per spec, requirement ids written `fn-250:R4`, and one coverage line per spec. Which specs a
  branch closes is computed (done at the head, not at the base, its task files touched here, and the close not
  inherited from a stacked, unmerged parent), and `flowctl spec closed-in-range --base <ref>` prints the set. Land
  selects the same specs from the forge when no branch name matches the pull request, and ignores a
  bookkeeping-only close. When the forge reports no push date, land's patience window uses the head's earliest
  check-suite creation time, then its committer date.

- **The pull-request body is a briefing for the reviewer.** It opens with why the change exists and what changes
  for a user or operator. Scope gives the size of the change, then the review steps in order: each step says what
  to check there and lists up to ten files that must be read, as links that wrap, each with its purpose and the
  requirement it serves. Mechanical, generated and undescribed files are counted in one line, with the few
  must-read files nobody described named by path. Coverage reads `R1 → group 1`. Verification ticks only what
  passed; failed and unverified gates stay unticked with their note. Blast radius, tradeoffs and open items
  follow, and an empty section is omitted. The body is as long as its authored content and no longer: about 800
  to 1,000 words for a 23-file pull request, and about 1,900 for one with 175 files and four specs, where the old
  form ran 2,700 to 3,700 words for 25 to 39 files. A house style in your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` shortens it
  further. This resolves the body-length report in #447. Thanks to @flecamos for the report.
  Under the hood: `flowctl` renders the body in one pass from the aid artifact, and the skill carries a validated
  skeleton of that artifact, so a real run is one `write` and one render. The compact and full forms, their size
  threshold, the machine-identity rows, the per-row evidence column, the review-plan section, the generated-by
  footer and the `--no-mermaid` flag are gone; artifact id, base and head ride in one HTML comment. A row's own
  requirement ids set its tag while coverage keeps every citation. Mentions in authored prose are made inert so
  `@dataclass` pings nobody; issue and pull-request numbers stay live links. The HTML lens and `html-input` are
  unchanged.
- The aid artifact accepts four optional authored strings (`userImpact`,
  `blastRadius`, `tradeoffs`, `openItems`) and an optional `outcome` (`pass`,
  `fail`, `unverified`) on each proof cell. The renderer ticks only `pass`;
  cells without an outcome render as plain items. The additions are additive:
  the schema version stays 1 and stored artifacts remain valid. See the
  [consumer contract](plugins/flow-next/docs/pr-cognitive-aid.md).
- make-pr leaves already-closed specs untouched and composes the aid artifact
  after any spec-close commit, so the
  artifact's head equals the pull request's head. An explicit `--base <branch>`
  now resolves against `origin/<branch>`, so a stale local base no longer
  widens the export. The make-pr instruction text an ordinary run loads drops
  from about 2,900 lines to under 600.

- PR aids written from sparse input remain reusable at make-pr's resolve step
  when base and head match. Explicit same-head successors still publish
  deliberate corrections to authored content.

- Broad staging now leaves new PR aid generations and write locks local after
  `flowctl init` refreshes the managed ignore block. HTML lenses and other
  artifacts remain trackable. In repositories that already track aid files,
  maintainers should run this one-time cleanup from the repository root and
  commit the index change (local files are kept):

  ```sh
  flowctl init
  git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch -- '.flow/artifacts/*/pr-cognitive-aid/*.json' '.flow/artifacts/*/pr-cognitive-aid/.write.lock'
  ```

  Flowctl never untracks files itself. Ignored aids remain per-clone; see the
  [consumer contract](plugins/flow-next/docs/pr-cognitive-aid.md#storage-and-identity).

- Chain dependencies first count as landed when the default base records the
  spec as closed. Otherwise, a locally closed dependency stays chained when
  its spec records a close at HEAD's merge-base with either its remote-tracking
  or local branch, even after that branch advances. Otherwise it counts as landed. A branch deleted from both refs,
  or no recorded branch, also counts as landed. True merges onto a non-default
  base conservatively stay chained. Base-checkout and no-base fallbacks remain.
- `spec close` reports every rewritten file in `modified_paths`, so callers can
  commit the complete close. A task create or start that reopens a closed spec
  reports the spec file the same way. make-pr never closes a spec that has no tasks, and
  land reads a closed spec with no task files as unfinished.

- Replace bare or scheduled repo-wide land calls with the [repository-wide
  recipe](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md#landing-upgrade). For each open PR,
  read specs at its remote head, select all whose `branch_name` equals its head
  branch, require at least one match and all matches closed, then invoke land
  for that PR with current authorization.
- Tighten the default review gate through the repository instruction file,
  branch protection, or `land.mergeVerdictCommand`. Green checks, a nonblocking
  GitHub review decision and zero unresolved threads can permit a merge when
  no reviewer has posted and no review is required. Bot-comment signals no
  longer gate landing. `land.patienceMinutes` remains push-anchored for caller
  authorization without human in-session authorization; human authorization
  waives the wait.
- Recover a conflicted chain child with the [manual single-layer
  rebase](plugins/flow-next/docs/troubleshooting.md#land-on-a-chain-chain-broken-a-retarget-conflict-or-a-pending-merge-async).
  Land uses native stacks when available, merges only the lowest open layer,
  and never deletes a branch an open PR still targets.
- Create or start a follow-up task to reopen a closed spec. Finishing that task
  does not close it automatically. A closed spec on an open PR remains in review
  in the tracker; only a confirmed merge permits terminal status. A merged rerun
  repeats only the configured tracker touchpoint. Its failure preserves `MERGED`
  and reports the merge commit. Run releases separately from land.

### Upgrade notes: retired keys


Existing configuration files still load. Land prints one notice naming ignored
keys and leaves the file unchanged. Remove these entries during your config
maintenance; only `land.patienceMinutes` and `land.mergeVerdictCommand` remain
active. Provenance below distinguishes recorded issues from implementation PRs
where no separate issue is recorded.

| Retired key | Former behavior and provenance |
|---|---|
| `land.release` | Release-follow. Issue FLOW-9, implementation PR #172. Release separately. |
| `land.reviewSignal` | Silence, approval or named-reviewer signal selection. Issue FLOW-9, PR #172. Use the review gate above. |
| `land.automatedReviewers` | Automated-reviewer allowlist for the silence signal. Issue FLOW-9, PR #172. |
| `land.reviewTrigger` | One-shot reviewer-bot summon comment. Issue FLOW-9, PR #172. Request reviewers separately. |
| `land.ciFixBudget` | Ledger-backed fix budget and durable needs-human label. Issue FLOW-9, PR #172; portability problem #368. |
| `land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` | Clean-review comment regex and old-default migration. PR #177 (incident PR #176), extended by PR #386 (incident PR #385); no separate issue recorded. |
| `land.requestReviewers` | One-shot human reviewer requests per head. Issue #359, PR #360. Request reviewers separately. |
| `land.patienceMinutesAfterReview` | Review-event-anchored patience. PR #394; no separate issue recorded. The retained window is push-anchored. |

### Upgrade notes: retired behaviors


| Retired behavior | Origin or reported issue; replacement |
|---|---|
| Repo-wide discovery, two-signal authorship probe and footer gate, local all-tasks-done eligibility, multi-PR worst-verdict aggregation | Issue FLOW-9 / PR #172; marker hardening #274. Use the head-bound recipe above and one verdict per named PR. |
| Ledger, durable CI-budget labels and skip state | FLOW-9 / PR #172; budget portability #368. Inspect the PR's commits/check attempts; one fix or rerun. Old land files are inert and need no migration. |
| Tick claim and PID reaper | PR #378; no separate issue recorded. The caller owns cadence; land holds no claim between invocations. |
| Post-merge spec close, base checkout, release, persist-push, rollback and re-entry | FLOW-9 / PR #172; lifecycle issue #345 / PR #350 and ignored-receipt staging issue #367 / PR #372. Close on the PR branch before opening; after merge only the configured tracker API touchpoint remains. |
| Plain-chain leased force-push cascade, patch-id review carry-over, resumable cascade, persisted merge-async UUID and pending-branch-delete janitor | Issue FLOW-83 / PR #432. Use native stacks when available; otherwise recover one conflicted child manually. Branch deletion requires a fresh proof that no open PR targets it. |
| Silence signal, clean-review classification, comment-pattern scan and stale-approval loop heuristics | FLOW-9 / PR #172; clean-comment PR #177, summary-table PR #386 and classifier PR #450 (no separate issues recorded). Use GitHub checks, review decision and unresolved threads. The unused `clean-review` judge preset is removed. |
| Reviewer-bot summons and human reviewer requests | FLOW-9 / PR #172 and issue #359 / PR #360. Repository owners arrange review requests outside land. |
| Merge-identity override `FLOW_PR_MERGE_CMD` | Issue #337 / PR #350; shell-argument fix #406 / PR #430. Land uses the authenticated standard merge API. This was environment-only, never a supported `land.*` key. |
| After-review patience window | PR #394, no separate issue recorded. Use retained push-anchored patience and current authorization. |
| Release-follow and emitted `RELEASED` verdict | FLOW-9 / PR #172. Release separately. `RELEASED` stays in the parser vocabulary but is never emitted. |
| Flow source/base-checkout handoff, land-ledger reads and post-merge persistence destination | PR #429, no separate issue recorded. Flow passes the named PR and current authorization; confirmed merge ends the run. |


The `LAND_VERDICT` terminal grammar and verdict vocabulary remain compatible;
`RELEASED` is retained for parsers but is no longer emitted. Old land ledger and
claim files are inert. No post-merge checkout, commit, push or local state write
remains. Issue IDs above come from the recorded history; implementation PRs and
incident PRs are labeled where no separate originating issue was recorded.

### Fixed

- **A worker no longer reports back while its own test run is still going.** A
  worker could start a long gate in the background and end its turn, so work
  received a result that did not exist yet. The worker now waits for every
  command it started and reads its exit code before returning, including a
  command the host moved to the background. Before accepting a return, work
  checks the task status and whether the worker left a command running; if it
  did, work waits within the dispatch TIMEBOX and sends a re-anchoring continuation worker into the same
  workspace after command exit, without counting the early return as a failed
  attempt. The worker also inspects another tree state in a temporary worktree
  instead of `git stash`.

## [flow-next 5.6.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **An idea or a brief handed to flow reaches the route judge on the first
  try.** In 5.6.0 the judge rejected the state a new idea arrives with, so a
  host spent minutes filling it in one field at a time and then routed on its
  own judgment; the request itself takes about 0.6 seconds. The intake state
  file now holds only `view` and its text (`intent`, or `spec_title` plus
  `spec_body`), and code assembles the repository, lifecycle, and PR facts.
  Existing specs were unaffected. On every preset, a state file missing several
  fields names all of them in one error from `flowctl judge`.

## [flow-next 5.6.0] - 2026-09-19

Users with a TypeSafe API key can route work, recognize clean automated reviews,
and select relevant memory with one short judgment request at each decision.
Ambiguous answers return to the host, and users without a key keep the existing
workflow.

### Added

- **Optional Jev judgment at six decision sites.** Clean-review classification
  precedes land's regex; flow combines route, fork, and QA questions in one
  request; memory search reranks up to 15 hits; confident mechanical tasks can
  use the configured fast tier. Long-running tasks receive a bridge
  recommendation. Existing review, QA, and merge gates retain their authority.
  Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the host environment; `judge.enabled=false` disables
  requests. See the [judge reference](plugins/flow-next/docs/judge.md) for the
  fixed floors, failure paths, and evaluation limits.

## [flow-next 5.5.1] - 2026-09-18

Teams that customize their spec scaffold get the last two sections back under their control. A custom `SPEC.md` shaped every section of a captured spec except the evidence block at the top and the coverage table at the end, which capture added by itself. Now the scaffold decides those too, so a team whose reviewers scroll past 15 to 20 lines of raw prompt text on every read can drop the block, and the check that keeps a `[user]` tag honest still runs.

### Changed

- **Your `SPEC.md` now decides every section of a captured spec, including the ones capture used to add by itself.** A team that customized the spec scaffold controlled every section except `## Conversation Evidence` and `## Requirement coverage`, which `/flow-next:capture` wrote outside the template, so 15 to 20 lines of raw prompt text sat at the top of each spec with no supported way to drop them. Capture now writes the sections the resolved template names and adds none it leaves out. Delete `Conversation Evidence` from the `auxiliary_sections` list in your `SPEC.md` and captured specs stop carrying the block; capture still collects the quotes during the run and still checks every `[user]` tag against them before it writes, so the source-tag guarantee from 4.10.2 holds. No config key is involved. The bundled template names both sections, so a repo without a custom `SPEC.md` sees no change. One behavior changes. A `SPEC.md` written from scratch with no `auxiliary_sections` list now gets no auxiliary sections from capture. Copy the list from the bundled template to keep them. The scaffold guide has a new "Leaving a section out" section. Thanks to @flecamos for the report and the source reading in #443.
- **Capture records a picked option as the option, without commentary.** When you answer one of capture's questions by picking an option, the evidence line now quotes the option label verbatim and marks it as a selection. It used to be possible for the line to carry an agent-written summary of what the choice meant, which is not something you typed. Also reported by @flecamos in #443.
- **The prose contract says where house style goes.** `docs/prose.md` now states that a project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` layers on top of the contract, that a length budget or reading level written there reaches every artifact the agent drafts, and that the contract sets no length rule on purpose. A house rule still yields to a section an emitting surface defines. Prompted by @flecamos in #447.

## [flow-next 5.5.0] - 2026-09-14

Two gaps closed in how the pipeline treats your own process. Before code exists, plan review and the technical refine pass now ask whether the plan repeats an edit or a decision and whether it bends the intended dependency direction, and the public claim states plainly what the pipeline does not prove about maintainability. And anyone who runs two flow-next sessions as the same person on one clone (a second terminal, a scheduled `flow --auto` tick, a second machine on a shared checkout) stops getting two workers silently dispatched onto one task: the second `flowctl start` refuses with a typed error instead of reading as a crash resume, and a genuine crash resume stays one explicit step.

### Changed

- **A same-actor `flowctl start` on an `in_progress` task refuses instead of resuming (fn-204).** The refusal is a typed error naming the task, the claimant, and the two ways forward: confirm the prior run ended and re-run with `--reclaim`, or leave the task to the run that holds it. `--reclaim` already meant "I am deliberately taking this claim" and becomes the one explicit resume path; `--force` keeps its takeover meaning, foreign-claim behaviour is untouched, and `ready`/`next` still list your own in-progress task as resumable. Work's direct-owner resume admission and `flow --auto`'s resume-consent row already gate on positive evidence that the prior run ended; they now pass `--reclaim` after that check instead of relying on the email coincidence, and no driver adds the flag on its own. No per-run identity, lease, heartbeat, or stale-claim reaping: one conductor per clone stays a rule, and this makes the second conductor fail instead of silently sharing. Surfaced by the codex review on #365; issues #369 and #370 describe the same collision from the consumer side.
- **Two rolling runs on one checkout no longer clobber each other's notes surface.** The rolling scheduler's notes pointer under `.flow/tmp/` is keyed by the `RUN_ID` the run already mints, so a second concurrent run writes its own pointer and neither run's cleanup removes the other's notes directory. The stale-pointer clearing at scheduler start is gone with it: a pointer left by an interrupted run has a different key and is never read.
- **Plan review and the technical refine pass ask two maintainability questions; the public claim says what the pipeline does not prove (fn-142).** The plan-review criteria gain a ninth item, Maintainability, answered from the plan as written: does the plan make the same edit or the same decision in more than one place, and does it add a back-edge against the intended dependency direction or new branching to the hottest function in its module. Each answer is a concrete finding or `none identified`, emitted as an advisory `maintainability:` block in the verdict; a finding contributes to NEEDS_WORK only when it names concrete duplication, a named back-edge, or a named function absorbing the branching, and "could be cleaner" or a recommended abstraction is out of scope. A named finding is also written as one line into the spec's `## Decision Context`; no new section, metric, threshold, or gate. The technical refine pass asks the same two questions once, so a spec on the direct route (no plan review) still answers them before build. The reasoning is SlopCodeBench (arXiv 2603.24755): quality prompts to the implementer move where the code starts, not how fast it decays, so the cheap place to ask is before code exists. The README and the docs index now carry the sentence "The pipeline proves the change does what was asked and records what it did; it does not prove the codebase stays maintainable." The plan-review prompt, its flowctl fallback, both pins, and the parity fixtures are updated together.

## [flow-next 5.4.0] - 2026-09-14

Teams that route implementation to another model over a CLI bridge get the same thing they already get in host: one owner that holds the whole task and decides its own delegation. Before this release, pinning `implementer:` to a model reached only by `codex exec` was silently ignored by the worker, and when a bridge was prompted by hand the child was forbidden from committing and from fanning out, so a long task became a chain of host-inserted returns and re-briefs. Now the worker hands the task to the bridged child, the child checkpoints and parallelizes under the same license the in-host worker holds, and the worker reviews the child's commit range before the normal review and gates.

### Changed

- **The bridged implementer owns the task, including its own fan-out.** When a project's routing block pins the implementer tier to a model the harness reaches only over a CLI bridge, the worker now hands the task to that child instead of implementing on the session model. The worker keeps what needs judgment (the persisted base, the range review against every acceptance criterion, the focused gates, review dispatch, `flowctl done`) and skips what would only be done twice (its own investigation and any worker-side scouting). The child gets a pointer prompt of identities and rails plus the usage guide's long-task brief, which now bans only a nested bridge and carries the judicious-subagent license, so the child decides its own parallelization exactly as an in-host worker does. The conductor never bridges. `worker.md` Phase 1b, an optional `IMPLEMENTER: <model> at <effort>` line in the step 3c dispatch for in-the-moment overrides, and a `stage: implement - ran (model: ...; delegated: <n>)` line in the done summary so a reviewer sees who implemented and how many subagents the child dispatched. "Never spawn another agent" was a widening that shipped in 5.3.0's follow-up (#436) with no requirement behind it; it is retired, and a bug memory entry records how three checks missed it.
- **A bridged implementer may commit checkpoints on its branch.** The bridge safety rule used to say the child never commits and the host keeps git, which left a one-task spec on a `codex exec` bridge with two bad shapes: one multi-hour run ending in a single uncommitted diff, or host-inserted returns with a timebox that taught the implementer to return partial (one task took 19 dispatches). The rule now reads: the child writes code and may commit checkpoints on the branch the host names; it still never pushes, never rebases or rewrites history, never decides scope, never issues a review verdict, and never spawns a nested bridge; the host keeps push, review, `flowctl done`, task state, and any history rewrite, and reviews the child's commit range from the recorded base on return. The usage guide carries the timebox-free long-task brief and names the sandbox fallback: codex `workspace-write` keeps `.git/` read-only, so a checkpointing child runs `danger-full-access` inside the asserted repo root, or the host commits between one-run-per-scope-unit dispatches. Thanks to @DanielKillenberger for the report (#431) and for the diagnosis in #437 that the worker never consulted the implementer tier.
- **The July Codex caveats are retired into dated watches.** The codex reach page, the platforms note, and the usage guide's self-bridge line no longer say that subagent model steering is unreliable or that a bridged child must stay flat. Steering works on both the role path and the explicit-parameter path since codex-cli 0.146.0 (fn-98, measured from the child rollout), with the precedence rule and the two dispatch gotchas stated where a user sets them. The child fan-out caveat becomes a watch: openai/codex#33267 is still open upstream and reported on codex-cli 0.144 to 0.145 with the gpt-5.6 family; its own minimal repro ran clean three of three on codex-cli 0.153.4 on 2026-09-14, and zero decode errors appeared across the month's seventeen exec-originated spawning runs and twenty-three spawning child threads. No other harness carries a new restriction. Watch spec fn-98 is closed against this release; its read-only-guarantee items stay open work.
- **Strategy and standing criteria guard the owner's license.** `STRATEGY.md` gains the design principle "The owner holds the license": whoever implements owns delegation, wrappers and conductors never fan out on the implementer's behalf, and safety rules bound push, history rewrite, scope, verdict, and nested bridges, never the owner's own delegation. `.flow/criteria.md` gains G3, judged by completion review on every spec: a change to any implementer brief, worker dispatch prose, or subagent license keeps the owner's delegation intact, and a never-list is diffed clause by clause against the spec that asked for it.

## [flow-next 5.3.0] - 2026-09-14

Teams whose specs depend on each other stop waiting on merges. A dependent spec used to sit until its parent's pull request landed, so every layer of a dependency chain cost one human merge before the next could start and the build loop idled in between. Now the dependent spec builds as soon as its parent is built, its pull request shows only its own layer, GitHub links the layers into one of its [stacked pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/get-started/about-stacked-prs) (in public preview since 2026-07-30, [announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-30-stacked-pull-requests-are-now-in-public-preview/)), and land drains the chain from the bottom without a hand rebase. Off GitHub, or when the preview is unavailable on a repository, the same chain works as plain dependent PRs; only the stack map and GitHub's own retarget are GitHub-only. Nothing is configured: the dependency graph a plan already records is the only input, and a spec with no dependencies behaves exactly as before.

The reviewer's journey changes in one place. Instead of one large PR after a serial wait, they get a chain of small ones, each with its own cognitive-aid body and a stack map in the merge box, reviewed and merged from the bottom up. Merge judgment stays theirs: nothing in this release merges on its own, and land still needs its existing consent and gates. The release's own two pull requests, #432 and #433, were the first live chain, built on 2026-09-13, linked into GitHub stack #434, and merged from the stack UI.

### Added

- **Dependent specs build on their parent's branch instead of waiting for its merge (fn-152).** When a parent spec's tasks are all done and its branch is on origin, the dependent spec becomes selectable in `flow --auto` (ready and backlog mode), in the attended ladder, and under a direct `/flow-next:work`. Work forks the spec branch from the parent's remote tip, make-pr opens the PR against the parent's branch and, on GitHub, links it into the parent's stack, and chained layers with nothing open are created ready so a human can merge them from the stack UI. A spec whose parent is still in progress, a spec with two open parents, or a second child of an already-chained parent parks with a stated reason and no strike. Linear chains only; no configuration key.
- **Land drains chains and GitHub stacks one frontier at a time (fn-149).** A dependent PR, with or without a GitHub stack over it, no longer breaks land or gets closed when its parent merges. Each tick classifies every PR from GitHub's stack object and its base ref and merges only the lowest open layer. On a stack it uses GitHub's [asynchronous stack merge](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#merge-a-pull-request-asynchronously) with a server-enforced head pin (a stale pin is refused before anything merges, verified live). A review verdict survives a rebase when the stable patch-id of the diff is unchanged, so a reviewer's clean comment on the original head keeps counting through GitHub's retargets and land's own. Above a merged parent on a plain chain, land rewrites the open layers bottom-up in a prepare-then-publish cascade with a leased push per layer and a resumable record, and it never deletes a merged branch while an open PR still targets it, which was the 2026-08-27 failure. Standalone PRs keep byte-identical verdicts, merge arguments, tail order, and ledger writes.

### Under the hood

- One read-only predicate, `flowctl spec chain <id>`, owns chain eligibility (parent open, all tasks done, branch on origin, linear, one `git ls-remote` at most, a failed remote read never reported as an absent branch); flowctl's spec-level task-admission gate (`ready --spec`, `next`, `ready --all`) treats the chain parent as satisfied, and every skill consumer calls the predicate instead of duplicating it. `pilot-log append` gains an optional `--reason` so the backlog decision-log row carries the `chained on <parent>; ` prefix.
- Make-pr detects a chain from history, the merge-base of HEAD with the parent's branch tip or merged-PR head, never from a scratch file; a merged parent is rewritten onto the chain base from that boundary on a create run only (`--dry-run` and `--update` never rewrite); stack linking uses the [stacks REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/stacks) with integer-typed payloads (the [gh-stack extension](https://github.com/github/gh-stack) is never required) and degrades to a plain chain layer with one stderr line on 404, 409, 422, or a transport error.
- Land's ledger gains one evidence binding per PR (verdict head, base, patch-id, window anchor), a pending merge-async uuid, a top-level `pending_branch_deletes` map swept at the start of every tick, and a `cascade` record that survives a lost lease or a lost write; an unread children count keeps the branch. The Codex mirror and the glossary (`chain`, `stack`, `layer`, `frontier`) are updated; the 2026-08-27 recovery memory now points at the chain rules. Details: [current chain recovery](plugins/flow-next/docs/troubleshooting.md#land-on-a-chain-chain-broken-a-retarget-conflict-or-a-pending-merge-async).
- Tests: flowctl chain states and admission gates over a bare origin; fence fixtures for every consumer under `set -e` with a stubbed `gh`; land fixtures for every shape, a three-layer chain with multi-commit squash parents, lease and lost-write resumption, the stale pin, and the janitor across four ticks; the merge-fence shell test now states its children count.

## [flow-next 5.2.2] - 2026-09-13

Five reported defects are fixed for people using the glossary, landing PRs from zsh or worktree setups, and GitHub or GitLab trackers; nothing else changes.

### Fixed
- **Glossary entries with both `_Avoid_` and `_Relates to_` no longer corrupt on `glossary add`.** The parser removed the two metadata lines cumulatively with offsets computed against the original body, so the second removal cut the wrong window and leaked a fragment into the definition on every add. Removals now apply in descending offset order in either authored line order, and the canonical rendering round-trips. Thanks to @flecamos for the report (#408).
- **Land's merge step works under zsh.** The merge command was invoked as an unquoted string and relied on bash word-splitting, so under zsh (macOS default login shell) `gh pr merge` was one command name and the merge failed with exit 127. The fence now builds the command as an array; the `FLOW_PR_MERGE_CMD` override keeps its contract (whitespace-split into argv, never eval'd). Thanks to @TechupBusiness for the report (#406).
- **Planned specs no longer record `status conflict (unmapped)` on GitHub/GitLab pushes.** A planned spec (all tasks todo) against capture's `status:backlog` label is an agreeing early state, so a requested todo/backlog is now a no-op at the tracker's slot instead of a conflict. The status-sync reference states that `perTracker.statusMap` is read by the Jira and Linear providers only. Thanks to @TechupBusiness for the report (#375).
- **A merged spec-text-only PR no longer counts as merge evidence.** The status projection classified `gh pr list` rows by state alone, so a merged PR whose whole diff was `.flow/specs/` and `.flow/tasks/` (the spec's own text landing under one-PR-per-gate) projected a still-open spec to In Review and re-derived it on every touchpoint. Each merged row is now probed for its changed files and counts only when it touches a path outside those two directories; a failed file probe degrades to `probe-error`, never `merged`. Thanks to @sn-furali for the report (#391).
- **Land's ci-fix step recovers when the PR branch is checked out in another worktree.** `gh pr checkout` refuses with `already checked out at '<path>'` in the Worktree Kit shape; the step now tells the agent to run the fix in that path, skipping the checkout and that checkout's branch restore, without creating or removing a worktree. Thanks to @TechupBusiness for the report (#411).

## [flow-next 5.2.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **Changing the implementation model or harness no longer forces task decomposition.** A ready cohesive spec keeps the direct route unless the user requests planning, separate human owners will implement, or delivery spans multiple PRs. Removed the routed-implementer trigger from Flow's shared rule and matching guidance; explicit plans, research, refinement, review, QA, and handoff requirements retain their existing behavior. Reported by @gmickel.

## [flow-next 5.2.0] - 2026-09-13

You can now carry a selected spec through PR convergence and merge in one flow run, while retaining the choice to stop before merge.

### Added
- **Continue a selected spec through gated landing.** Use `flow <spec> --until=merge` or `flow --auto <spec> --until=merge`; interaction mode and destination are independent. Flow invokes the existing land stage, which owns CI and review convergence, merge gates, spec close, and persistence. Tick mode performs at most one landing tick; longer runs can continue across external waits without consuming pilot strikes. Release and tracker actions retain their existing authorization and configuration.

### Changed
- **An attended rerun with an existing PR offers landing.** Flow asks once unless the current item already has explicit landing authorization. Declining or leaving the question unanswered causes no landing mutation; default unattended flow still stops before merge. Consent stays scoped to the selected spec and PR across active retries, and a fresh session needs the flag again or current explicit authority. Recovery observes an already merged PR and resumes only its remaining authorized tail. Existing verdict names and standalone land behavior remain unchanged.
- **Capture saves the spec before offering review.** An interactive capture request now writes the source-tagged spec, shows its summary, and offers the saved file in the editor. The redundant approve-and-write checkpoint is removed, including the second approval after choosing a split. Duplicate/rewrite choices, material questions, chart-risk overrides, glossary and readiness consent remain; plan/refine approval and autofix's `--yes` write gate are unchanged.


### Fixed
- **Landing preserves the source branch.** An open-PR handoff refuses a wrong branch or detached HEAD before it can fast-forward a local ref, including when the checked-out commit already matches the PR. Correct-branch catch-up and already-merged recovery remain available.
- **Codex can dispatch the landing stage.** Generated flow instructions now use the host's actual skill spelling. Generator and installed-consumer checks cover the landing call and confirmed sibling dispatches while preserving internal authorization identifiers.

Deprecated pilot and interview aliases remain available in this release. New recipes should use `flow --auto --tick` and `refine`.

## [flow-next 5.1.1] - 2026-09-12

Plan review no longer asks for a task split. A spec with zero tasks or one owner task is the default route, so the reviewer's job is the spec's content and, when task specs exist, their consistency with it.

### Changed
- **Plan review treats task decomposition as the owner's decision.** The shared review prompt and the RepoPrompt prompt state that task count, decomposition, and dispatch shape are never a finding; the consistency and `Touches` checks apply only when task specs are supplied; a missing approach order or test sequence stays a spec-content finding that the owner resolves without a prescribed split.

## [flow-next 5.1.0] - 2026-09-12

Teams that run Flow-Next unattended get one driver instead of two. One `/flow-next:flow --auto` invocation carries a ready spec to a draft PR, hop after hop, classifying each hop from the same routing references the attended conductor reads, so the route you see in `--explain` is the route the unattended run takes. Pilot users keep working through the alias for one release. `/flow-next:pilot` is retired in 5.1.0, forwards to `flow --auto --tick` with one deprecation line, and the release after 5.1.0 removes it.

Before this release an unattended run meant a driver looping `/flow-next:pilot` and paying a full re-anchor (skill re-read, config snapshot, selection, classification, branch resolution) plus the loop interval at every stage boundary, with only `qa` into `make-pr` allowed to chain. Now the driver invokes `/flow-next:flow --auto [<spec-id>]` once and the conductor classifies, dispatches the stage with `mode:autonomous`, verifies from observed state, records the hop, and re-classifies until it reaches a terminal (the PR exists, deferred to land, asked, blocked, needs human, no work). Every rail pilot had moves across unchanged (the strikes ledger, the dirty-tree refusal, the all-done PR probe, the never-merge boundary, the decision log), and `--tick` keeps the one-stage-per-invocation shape for hosts without stable long sessions. The operator still reads one `PILOT_VERDICT` line at the end and still owns the merge; what they no longer do is schedule a loop to get from work to a PR.

### Changed

- **One unattended invocation now carries a spec from ready to draft PR.** Every hop ends with the same receipts, evidence echo, and ledger write a pilot tick ended with, so a run that dies at hour six resumes from disk on the next invocation; nothing is resumed from transcript. `--tick` runs exactly one hop and stops, which is what a pilot tick was. Both shapes end with the one `PILOT_VERDICT` line drivers already parse; a long-horizon run names every dispatched stage joined by `+` (`stage=work+qa+make-pr`) and carries the last hop's verdict.
- **Unattended classification reads the routing reference.** Pilot's private stage table is gone. `--auto` reads `route-matrix.md` for the spec-state rows, `plan-vs-no-plan.md` for a ready spec with no tasks and no recorded route (it records the route with `spec set-no-plan` or `spec clear-no-plan` before any mint and echoes the deciding signal), and `gate-selection.md` for the review, QA, and completion-review gates. What stays in the unattended workflow (`skills/flow-next-flow/auto.md`, read only when `--auto` is parsed) is what the reference cannot carry: the ready-flag consent boundary, selection order, the collision and re-bless checks, the PR probe, the branch matrix, the evidence echo, and the ledger. `--explain` under `--auto` prints the selected spec, the classified stage with its routing row and gate, the consulted fields, the PR probe, and would-clear ledger entries, with no write, no checkout, and no dispatch.
- **`pipeline.qa=auto` now takes effect unattended.** `flow --auto` reads the key through the same gate-selection reference attended flow reads; a skipped QA hop records `stage: qa - skipped(config: pipeline.qa=auto: <reason>)` and advances to make-pr. `on` and `off` are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **The attended refusal is inverted for `--auto`.** Attended `flow` still refuses under every autonomy marker; its line now reads `NEEDS_HUMAN: /flow-next:flow is attended - run /flow-next:flow --auto for unattended runs`. `--auto` refuses only under Ralph (`FLOW_RALPH`, `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`) with pilot's exact terminal line, because it sets `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS` and `mode:autonomous` for the stages it dispatches. Flow, `flow --auto`, and Ralph are three drivers and are never nested; `--auto` never dispatches land or a second driver. Land is unchanged and `DEFERRED_TO_LAND` keeps its meaning.
- **Backlog mode is `flow --auto --backlog`.** `references/backlog-mode.md` moved under the flow skill; `pilot.autonomy=backlog` still enables it; every safety invariant stays enforcing bash at its site. In long-horizon mode a backlog run drives one selected item to its terminal and stops; the next invocation selects the next item.

### Deprecated

- **`/flow-next:pilot` is an alias for `/flow-next:flow --auto --tick` for this release only.** The command shim and the `skills/flow-next-pilot/` stub rewrite the arguments (`--spec <id>` becomes the positional id; `--backlog`, `--dry-run`, `--review`, `--research`, `--depth` pass through), print `pilot is now flow --auto --tick; this alias is removed in the next release` to stderr, and behave byte-for-byte as a pilot tick. The release after 5.1.0 removes the shim, the stub, the command entry, the conduct page, the Codex mirror, and the sync-roster rows. Update `/loop`, `/goal`, and Ralph recipes now. The default recipe is one `flow --auto` invocation per item; the loop recipe is `/loop 30m /flow-next:flow --auto --tick`.
- **`pipeline.chainStages` is deprecated and removed with the alias.** It is honoured under `--tick` (the `qa+make-pr` tick it was built for) and ignored with one stderr notice in long-horizon mode, where the hop loop already runs make-pr as the next hop.

### Under the hood

- Config keys (`pilot.autonomy`, `pilot.gateClasses`, `pipeline.qa`, `pipeline.chainStages`), flowctl verbs (`flowctl pilot strikes list|clear`, `flowctl pilot-log`), the ledger path under the git common dir, the decision-log path `.flow/pilot-runs/`, and the `PILOT_VERDICT` name are not renamed; a rename is a separate, deliberate break for a later major.
- Published counts drop by one skill and one command (pilot moves to the alias tier); registry manifests count shipped directories and are unchanged.
- Terminal-parity and wall-clock results for long-horizon versus tick execution are pending.

## [flow-next 5.0.1] - 2026-09-12

A patch on 5.0.0; read the 5.0.0 entry below for the release itself.
- **Gate receipts no longer fail on a stray `.git` above the working tree** (#418). The repo probe stops at any `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` entry, mirroring git's own discovery boundary, so metadata git never examined (an empty `/tmp/.git` broke every outside-a-repo probe) cannot turn a "not a git repository" result into a tooling error.
- **A bare `/flow-next:flow` proceeds to the next best step** (#420, shipped in the plugin under this version; the 5.0.0 entry describes the ladder). It resolves the item this conversation last touched, then the spec matching the current branch, then asks to capture intent no spec holds yet, then picks the next open spec by judgement with an inline pick on ties, then asks what to work on.
- **README and plugin docs match the shipped routing contracts** (#419). The route narrative in pipeline-variations, the plan-signal wording, and the flowctl, teams, and running-lean pages now describe the 5.0.0 behaviour instead of the pre-flow menus.

## [flow-next 5.0.0] - 2026-09-12

Developers can hand Flow-Next whatever they have, from nothing to a pasted bug report to a spec with an open PR, and get the smallest sufficient route chosen, run, and stopped at the next decision that is theirs. The routing rules that capture, plan, and work already applied in their own words now live in one shared reference, so the recommendation you read and the route that runs are the same rule. Direct execution is the default for a ready spec; decomposition is the exception with a stated reason. Live QA can switch itself on only where a live surface is what the spec is about. This is a major release: two command names change, and the rest of this entry is written so a plugin user can migrate and use the new surface without opening the skill files.

### 1. Breaking and renamed surfaces

- **`/flow-next:guide` is removed.** Its matrix moved into the shared route matrix and `/flow-next:flow --explain` is its replacement. Before: `/flow-next:guide I have a spec with an open PR, what next?` printed a recommendation and refused to run anything. After: `/flow-next:flow --explain <the same words>` prints the route, its positive signal, the safe skip and its kind, and why not the alternatives, in the same recommendation shape, and writes nothing under `.flow/`. Drop `--explain` and the same invocation runs the route. There is no alias for guide; a `/flow-next:guide` invocation on this release is an unknown command on every host.
- **`/flow-next:interview` is renamed to `/flow-next:refine`.** Same skill, same `business`, `technical`, and `both` scopes, same flags; the skill directory is `flow-next-refine` and every canonical surface that names the command now says refine. Before: `/flow-next:interview fn-12 --scope=business`. After: `/flow-next:refine fn-12 --scope=business` (Codex: `$flow-next-refine`; OpenCode: `/flow-next-refine`). For this release `/flow-next:interview` stays on every host as a deprecated alias: the `skills/flow-next-interview/` stub and the `commands/interview.md` shim print one line (`Deprecated: /flow-next:interview is now /flow-next:refine (this alias is removed next release). Continuing with refine.`) and forward the arguments unchanged. The stub is non-triggering (`disable-model-invocation: true`, Codex catalog flag off), so prose that says "interview the spec" reaches refine through its description, never the stub. The stub, the shim, and their sync-roster and legacy-cleanup rows are removed in the release that follows this one, so one release of overlap is the whole migration window.
- **What to change on your side.** Replace `/flow-next:guide` with `/flow-next:flow --explain` (or plain `/flow-next:flow` where you wanted the route run) in scripts, `/loop` and `/goal` prompts, `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` policy paragraphs, and team docs. Replace `/flow-next:interview` with `/flow-next:refine` in the same places before the next release; the alias keeps them working until then. `/flow-next:pilot` and `/flow-next:land` invocations are unchanged, so an unattended `/loop 30m /flow-next:pilot` recipe needs no edit. Published counts are unchanged: 28 commands and 32 stable skills (flow replaced guide; the alias is a stub, never a stable skill or a new command).

### 2. `/flow-next:flow`, the attended conductor

- **What it accepts.** `/flow-next:flow <anything>`: nothing at all ("what should I do next"), an idea or a request for a change, a spec or task id, a tracker issue id or URL (read through the access the session already has: the sync bridge, an MCP, `gh`, `glab`), a branch or a path, a pasted bug report or console output, a how or why question about the code, something slow to speed up, a cleanup that keeps behaviour, a design fork to settle, or the live conversation. Flow adds no input adapter and no classifier; it reads what it was given and routes on content and context, never on input kind. A bare `/flow-next:flow` auto-progresses to the next best step, resolving the item this conversation last touched, then the spec whose branch matches the current branch, then asking to capture intent no spec holds yet, then picking the next open spec by judgement with an inline pick on ties, and only then asking what to work on.
- **What it does.** It matches the starting state against the shared route matrix, runs the routed stage skill by name (capture, refine, plan, plan-review, work, qa, make-pr, resolve-pr keep their own contracts, receipts, and gates; flow re-implements none of them), re-evaluates after each hop, and stops at the next human decision with a self-contained report: `Flow stopped at:`, `Route taken: <hop> -> <hop>`, one `stage: <name> - ran | skipped(<kind>: <detail>) | failed(...)` line per stage reached, and `Next:`. A run from intent ends when the PR exists; a run on an open PR converges it (resolve-pr, CI fixes, re-review) and stops when merge is the only step left. It never merges, never closes a spec, and never fabricates a review, QA, or completion verdict.
- **Picks are inline; only run-ending decisions stop it.** A pick among options a stage produced (prospect's ranked candidates, a chart briefing's capture-or-split question, refine's choices when it hands back) is asked inline under the one-question-per-hop rule and the run continues; the answer lands on the `Route taken` line as `prospect [picked: <candidate>]`. The run stops only when the PR exists, merge is the only step left, a stage surfaces a decision that ends the run, or a blocking question this hop must ask is not a pick. Before any "which approach" question, flow classifies the fork per the prototype-before-ask rule: an observable answer is settled by running something.
- **A request that names no skill reaches flow.** The skill description names the request shapes above, so on hosts that match skills by description, "this endpoint is slow" or "why does this guard exist" routes through flow without a slash command. Where the host needs the command, `/flow-next:flow <the same words>` is the spelling; on OpenCode it is `/flow-next-flow`.
- **`--explain` writes nothing and dispatches nothing.** It prints the recommendation shape (`Next:`, `Route:`, `Signal:`, `Skip/narrow:`, `Skip kind:`, `Why not the alternatives:`) and stops. A plain run records the route for a ready spec with no tasks (`flowctl spec set-no-plan` for direct, `spec clear-no-plan` for plan) only after the explain stop, so an explain run leaves `.flow/` byte-identical (#416).
- **Never under pilot or Ralph.** Flow, pilot, and Ralph are three drivers and are never nested. Under any autonomy marker (`FLOW_RALPH`, `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS`, `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`, `AUTONOMOUS=1`, a `mode:autonomous` token) flow stops before any read with `NEEDS_HUMAN: /flow-next:flow is attended - run /flow-next:pilot for unattended ticks`, and it never dispatches `/flow-next:pilot` or `/flow-next:land` from inside a run. Pass `--review=<backend>` and flow forwards it unchanged to every stage it dispatches.

### 3. The routing reference: six files, one matrix

- **Six files owned by the flow skill**, under `skills/flow-next-flow/references/`, one per rule and each opening with a decision record (source, trigger, purpose, evidence, disposition): `route-matrix.md`, `spec-count.md`, `plan-vs-no-plan.md`, `gate-selection.md`, `prototype-before-ask.md`, and `tail.md`. Flow's route step, `flow --explain`, capture's closer, plan's next-steps menu, and work's zero-task ask read the same files, and each reads only the file its current step needs, so explanation, closer, and execution cannot diverge. Router staleness is a defect: adding or removing a skill updates the matrix in the same change, and a test asserts every pointer names a file that exists.
- **The route matrix and the pipeline-variations narrative now carry eleven worked variants.** The six that existed (epic; feature with known requirements; no-plan; small task; bug or defect; docs or chore) plus five new starting states, each row naming its positive signal, its safe skip, and the skip kind:
  - **Refactoring** (rename, extract, inline, dedupe, move): pin the contract first. A characterization test, snapshot, or equivalence check over current behaviour is the R-ID; then work and review. New behaviour named anywhere makes it a feature with cleanup inside.
  - **Performance** (a measured slowness to move once): baseline on a real surface before any change. The baseline and its target are the R-ID; the post-change measurement is the evidence. A fix motivated by reading source instead of a measurement is not evidence.
  - **Hill climb** (one metric against a target through repeated attempts): work against a frozen harness. The target is the R-ID and each attempt's comparable measurement is the evidence; the target is never relaxed to meet it.
  - **Investigation** (a read-only how or why question): a cited answer from the repo, git history, and the bug and decision memory, with no `.flow/` write and no PR. `why-scout` for why questions, the repo, docs, and practice scouts for how questions, `/flow-next:visual` when the answer is a shape. When the answer is a prerequisite for a change already asked for, the change is routed and its stage reads.
  - **Prototype** (a design or behaviour fork whose answer is observable): settle it per `prototype-before-ask.md`. The observed decision and its evidence are the output, then the real build routes to capture or work. No decision means no prototype.
- **The matrix also names the starting states the other skills own** (strategy, prospect, chart, a theme with no nameable end state, a structured brief, a tiny local change with a `triage-skip` receipt, a valid spec with unresolved product questions, design review of a zero-task spec, a spec with tasks, a spec with all tasks done, a spec with an open PR, features, visual, prose, and "unsure which applies"), so `--explain` answers the "what next" question from any state a shipped skill covers. The rows are an inventory, not a precedence order; each hop re-evaluates.

### 4. Direct execution is the default; plan needs a positive signal

- For a ready spec with no tasks and no recorded route, the route is `/flow-next:work <spec-id> --no-plan`. Plan is chosen only on one of four positive signals: the user asked for a plan; separate human owners will implement; delivery is staged across several PRs; the implementer is routed out of the session model (an `implementer:` line in the project routing block that points at a bridge or a cheaper tier). Risk, size, and file count never trigger plan on their own. Design risk routes to `/flow-next:plan-review` (which reviews a spec with zero tasks); unresolved product or authority choices route to `/flow-next:refine`.
- Capture's and plan's `Recommended next:` closers print this rule's result on both the manual and the flow path (`Recommended next: /flow-next:work <id> --no-plan - ready cohesive spec; no positive plan signal`, or `/flow-next:plan <id> - <which signal>`). Under flow, capture applies the rule itself, sets `no_plan` when it resolves to direct, and writes no placeholder requirement-coverage table on that route. User-invoked capture keeps the explicit `--no-plan` opt-in and never sets the field on its own judgment. The direct route keeps implementation review per `review.backend`, acceptance coverage from the single implicit owner task, the single-task completion-review skip, and QA per `pipeline.qa`.
- Whether one intent is one spec or several is the spec-count rule (`spec-count.md`); which review, QA, and completion gate applies, and from which config key or flag, is `gate-selection.md`; where an attended run ends is `tail.md`.

### 5. `pipeline.qa` gains `auto`

- **Semantics.** `pipeline.qa` is a string enum `off | on | auto`; any other value is treated as `off`. `off` (the default): QA runs only when you invoke `/flow-next:qa <spec>`. `on`: every spec gets one live pass at all-tasks-done, before make-pr, under pilot and flow alike. `auto`: QA runs at all-tasks-done when the spec's acceptance describes UI behaviour on a drivable surface and a target can be started (a documented dev server, a deploy URL, or a running instance the QA skill can reach); otherwise the stage records `skipped(config: pipeline.qa=auto: <reason>)` on its `stage:` line, never a silent absence. QA under `auto` re-drives every UI-observable criterion regardless of what the worker narrated, so it adds no overlap that `on` does not already have.
- **Enable.** `flowctl config set pipeline.qa auto` (or `on`, or `off`). Setup asks the question once on an unset key, with `off` recommended when nothing runs in a browser yet, and recommends `/flow-next:features` when the answer is `on` or `auto`, since live QA reads `.flow/features/` to navigate the app; the setup summary prints `Live QA: <off|on|auto>`. `/flow-next:prime`'s QA-readiness line recommends enabling `pipeline.qa auto` (or `on`) once the repo passes operability tier 3 and the DR-core criteria.
- **Pilot is unchanged.** Pilot activates the QA stage only on the literal `on`; `auto` is judged by flow, which is attended. flowctl stores the value and never interprets it.

### 6. `/flow-next:refine --scope=research`, the read-first pass

- **What it does.** It asks nothing and runs no question rounds. It dispatches four read-only scouts in parallel over the spec's or task's surface: `docs-scout` (official docs, version anchored on the repo's manifest scan), `practice-scout` (current best practices and pitfalls), `docs-gap-scout` (the repo's own docs that must change), and `memory-scout` (the memory tree entries that apply), plus `github-scout` when `scouts.github` is on. It writes one `## Resolved via Research` section on the spec (or the task body for a task target): one sub-block per scout that ran, one bullet per finding, a source on every line, through refine's existing write-back and read-back contract, so you ratify the section before it lands.
- **The skip rule, shared with plan.** The pass is observably skipped, with the reason printed and nothing written, when the target already carries `## Resolved via Research` or when the spec's tasks carry plan's scout findings (it names the task that holds them). When either case would skip but the spec now names a library or API that neither mentions, the pass reruns for that delta only and appends under the right sub-block. `--force` reruns the whole pass and replaces the section. Plan's research step applies the same rule in reverse: when the section exists it skips the same four scouts (repo-scout, spec-scout, and the gap analyst still run), and when it runs them it writes the section too, so the pass never runs twice.
- **When flow routes to it.** The route matrix's ready-spec row carries the read-first signal: the spec names a library or API the repo does not already use. On that signal flow runs `/flow-next:refine <spec-id> --scope=research` before work on either route; the signal is satisfied by the section or by a plan that ran the scouts, so it never runs by default. `flow --auto` (the unattended conductor of a later spec) never runs it.
- **Invocation.** `/flow-next:refine fn-12 --scope=research`, `/flow-next:refine fn-12.3 --scope=research`, `/flow-next:refine fn-12 --scope=research --force`. A file-path target prints `research: skipped(policy: research writes a spec or task section; give a spec or task id)` and stops.

### 7. `why-scout`, a read-only agent for rationale questions

- **What it answers.** "Why was Y built this way", "why does X guard against Z", "why did this change". It starts from a pointer (a file, a symbol, a line range, a commit, a PR number, or a spec id), anchors on `git blame` and the PRs behind the commits, reads the tracker thread only through access the session already has (the sync bridge or an MCP when one is configured; it adds no credentials and no adapter), then the bug and decision memory tracks, and widens only as the evidence chain leads.
- **Confidence tiers.** Every finding carries one of `direct` (a commit message, PR body, review comment, decision record, or spec sentence states the reason, quoted), `supported` (linked artifacts point at the reason: a fix commit closing the issue, a matching bug memory entry, a test added in the same commit), `inferred` (the scout's reading of the diff, with what the inference rests on), or `unknown` (the chain ran out, with where it ended and what would resolve it); the caller may not rewrite a tier.
- **Placement.** The route matrix's investigation row names it for why questions beside the existing scouts for how questions. It is tool-enforced read-only like the other scouts (`disallowedTools: Edit, Write, Task`) and adds no command; flow dispatches it, and you can dispatch it by name like any other agent.

### 8. One read-back contract for capture, refine, and plan

- The draft is written once to a temporary file (`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-<skill>-draft-<slug>-<suffix>.md`, `.json` for plan's task set) and that file is what the flowctl `--file` or `--from-json` call consumes. You see a compact summary instead of the draft: `Title`, `Criteria` (plan: tasks, sizes, waves, R-ID coverage), the source tally where tags exist, the split proposal when one exists, and the recommended route from the routing reference. One ask follows, with `approve and write`, `open in editor` (the file is re-read after the editor round, so the write consumes what you saw), `abort`, plus free text for edits. Edit cycles print only the diff, and the full draft prints only on request. Before: three full copies of the spec per edit cycle (print, re-read, re-print). After: one file, one summary, one diff per cycle.
- Unchanged: ratification precedes every `.flow/` write, autofix still requires `--yes`, the no-self-blessing rule (the ask never recommends `approve and write` while unverified `[inferred]` items remain), and each skill's post-approve consent gates (glossary, mark-ready, tracker). The contract is `docs/read-back.md`; capture, refine's write-back, and plan's task read-back cite it at their read-back step.

### 9. Shipped skill and agent prose no longer carries spec-provenance tags

- The `fn-NNN` markers that recorded which spec introduced a rule are removed from the skill bodies, references, command shims, and agent definitions the host loads. The rules are unchanged; the prompts the agent reads are shorter and no longer point at spec files a user's install does not have. The history stays in git and in this changelog.

### 10. Evidence

- **Routing accuracy.** A pre-registered non-inferiority study (September 2026, 90 draws on one frontier model at medium effort) compared the retired guide matrix (baseline) against the shared routing reference read through flow's pointers (candidate) on 27 fixture situations. On the 9 verdict-bearing discriminating items across 3 draws each, baseline scored 24/27 and the candidate 27/27, so the candidate is non-inferior under the registered rule (`B >= A - 3`); the candidate read the required reference file on every one of its 45 draws. Superiority was never the claim and is not confirmed. One open item is recorded: on one fixture both arms chose chart where the key expects a question.
- **Review passes.** Both tasks went through cross-family implementation review on the `codex` backend: the conductor and routing work reached SHIP on round 2 after three findings were fixed; the refine, research, and why-scout work reached SHIP on round 3 after six findings were fixed. Every conduct checklist (`agent_docs/conduct/flow.md`, `refine.md`, `why-scout.md`) states falsifiable behaviours anchored on the skill's terminal outputs.
- **Tests.** Behaviour or contract only: the `pipeline.qa` enum validation, the flow-path `no_plan` write, the read-back summary payload shape, every consumer's pointer naming a reference file that exists, the alias stub forwarding and non-triggering flags, the research skip decided from the section or the plan findings, the why-scout's tool-enforced read-only frontmatter, and the routing-surface sweep that fails on any canonical mention of the retired guide skill. Codex mirrors regenerate twice with no diff.
- **What follows the release.** The flow-next.dev pages (the flow page, the skill page swap, the revised route walkthrough, the site changelog beat) are written after this release is cut so the copy describes shipped behaviour; until then the docs site describes the previous release.

## [flow-next 4.18.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- QA passes now preserve populated requirement coverage when writing their verdict receipt, instead of failing with a JSON parsing error. Empty or unset coverage still defaults to an empty object.

## [flow-next 4.18.0] - 2026-09-10

Developers can hand a ready, cohesive spec to one capable coding agent and keep the full acceptance contract through implementation and verification. Separate task planning remains available when dependencies, ownership, staged delivery or execution constraints benefit from decomposition.

### Changed

- **Direct execution is the recommended route for a ready cohesive spec.** Use `/flow-next:work <id> --no-plan`; the choice survives task creation and continuation. Explicit spec/design review remains available without task files, and configured implementation review, coverage, completion-review policy and opt-in QA retain their contracts.
- Internal benchmarking showed that Flow-Next’s direct route can produce higher-scoring implementations with capable frontier coding models.

## [flow-next 4.17.0] - 2026-09-09

Developers working in a compatible managed host can keep reviews on the host's selected provider account while retaining Flow-Next's findings, fix loop and receipts. The host supplies the session's execution path; users choose their review backend as before. Standalone users keep their existing CLI workflow, and a configured managed-provider failure stops the review instead of silently switching accounts through a local CLI.

### Added

- **Managed hosts can run reviews through their scoped execution provider.** A host can supply a local endpoint and session token for Codex, Claude, Cursor or Copilot reviews while Flow-Next owns prompts, rounds, verdicts and receipts. Standalone users keep ordinary CLI execution. Managed completion reviews can require scoped execution before reserving work with `--require-managed-execution`; configured provider failures never fall back to a local CLI. The hook ships inside the installed launcher runtime.

## [flow-next 4.16.1] - 2026-09-08

A maintenance release for anyone installing flow-next into Codex or running the tracker and task tooling day to day. Reinstalling the Codex plugin no longer risks a broken Codex startup or a garbled config on Windows, a forced task takeover with a custom note now actually hands the task over, and anonymous tracker uploads stop asking for credentials they never needed. Under the hood, a five-reviewer pass over the Python removed 141 lines of dead paths without changing a single prompt byte; the review surfaced the defects fixed below.

### Fixed

- **Codex reinstalls are safe again.** Codex installs recover duplicate Flow-Next agent registrations left behind when opening comment markers were removed. The installer preserves unrelated settings and role overrides, places the thread limit in the correct table, and validates the merged config before replacing it with a private backup. Conflicting user-owned roles or malformed unrelated TOML stop the install instead of breaking Codex startup. Reported by @gmickel.
- **Windows Codex installs keep non-ASCII settings intact.** Config and role files are read and written as UTF-8 regardless of the system locale, so a `UnicodeDecodeError` no longer aborts the install and user settings with non-ASCII text survive the merge.
- **Codex hook normalization no longer disturbs settings that follow commented TOML table headers or array tables.** Cursor install verification now detects missing or unexpected nested payload files instead of reporting a clean install over a partial one.
- **Forced task takeovers transfer ownership when a custom claim note is supplied.** Previously the note path skipped the transfer, leaving the task claimed by the previous owner.
- **Tracker hardening.** Anonymous tracker uploads proceed without resolving provider credentials, echoed Jira Basic credentials are redacted in output, and tracker chart locks reject symlinked lock directories.

### Removed

- **Dead Python paths.** Unused abstractions, registry fields, helpers, and repeated checks across flowctl, the tracker package, and OpenCode generation are gone; production Python is 141 lines smaller. Public contracts, skill prose, and emitted review prompts are byte-for-byte unchanged, pinned by the existing prompt tests. (fn-224)

## [flow-next 4.16.0] - 2026-09-05

Teams conducting flow-next from OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, Factory Droid or OpenCode can now get a Claude-family review verdict through the packaged review path, with the same receipt, model ladder, round counter and fix-and-re-review loop as every other CLI backend. Before, the only way to that verdict from those hosts was to describe a `claude -p` call by hand: no ladder, no record of the model that ran, no round counter, and a different review surface every time someone typed it.

### Added

- **A Claude-family reviewer from any host, as a first-class backend.** `flowctl config set review.backend claude` (or `claude:<model>:<effort>`, `--review=claude`, a per-task `set-backend`) routes plan, implementation and completion reviews through the Claude Code CLI; the verdict lands as a receipt (`mode: "claude"`, the model and effort that actually ran, the session id the next round resumes), the strongest-available ladder steps the ranking on the CLI's model-unavailable signature and floors without failing, and the deterministic round cap and fix loop apply unchanged. Independence follows the writer's model family, not the host: when a Claude model wrote the diff (always on Claude Code, and on Cursor, Droid or OpenCode with a Claude session model) the review is same-family - it still runs, the receipt says so, and the review skills say so once - so prefer `codex` or `host` there when an independent verdict is the point. `/flow-next:setup` offers the backend when the `claude` CLI is on PATH. Under the hood: `flowctl claude impl-review | plan-review | completion-review | validate | deep-pass` over `claude -p` with the prompt on stdin and a fixed read-only argv (`--permission-mode dontAsk --tools Read Grep Glob --strict-mcp-config` - no shell, no write tool, no MCP); the reviewed diff is delivered by path under `.flow/tmp/claude-review/<receipt-id>-<base7>-<head7>.diff`; sessions resume via `--resume <session_id>`; the unavailable signature is exit 0 with `is_error`, a 404 and the selected-model text, or the `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` stderr tag; no first-round three-draw fan-out (codex-only by design). Docs: `docs/flowctl.md` § claude, `docs/orchestration.md` § Review backends, `docs/platforms.md` § Claude Code CLI review backend.

### Changed

- **Unconfigured `codex` and `copilot` reviews now start on GPT-6 Astra.** The review-backend rankings put `gpt-6-astra` at the top for both CLIs (Copilot also lists `claude-fable-5.1` after the OpenAI rungs), so a repo with `review.backend codex` and no model pinned gets Astra on the first dispatch; the fallback ladder still steps down the ranking on the CLI's model-unavailable signature and caches the rung that works, so an older CLI or an org policy that withholds the model degrades instead of failing. Cursor's ranking is unchanged because Cursor receives no further OpenAI models (contract wind-down 12 November 2026). Ralph's prompt templates and the docs show current ids only beside a date; every other example uses `<model>` placeholders.

## [flow-next 4.15.0] - 2026-09-04

Specs written from the command line now read like captured ones: they carry the same section structure every downstream reader expects, so plan review, R-ID coverage, completion review, and the generated PR body find a goal, boundaries, and acceptance criteria where they look for them instead of exporting blanks. Renaming a spec is safe in the same way - a retitled spec keeps its branch instead of stranding the old slug.

### Changed

- **Specs created with `flowctl spec create` now carry the same structure as captured specs.** `flowctl spec create` and `flowctl spec skeleton` render the canonical `templates/spec.md` (Goal & Context, Architecture & Data Models, API Contracts, Edge Cases & Constraints, Acceptance Criteria, Boundaries, Decision Context) instead of the legacy six-heading skeleton, so plan review, R-ID coverage, completion review, and the make-pr export read a CLI-born spec the same way they read a captured one - `spec create --plan-file` specs no longer export empty goal and boundaries or fall back to the spec id as the PR title. The documented override cascade `SPEC.md` -> `spec.md` -> bundled template is now applied by flowctl itself. Existing spec files are untouched; specs written with the old headings still export through read-only synonyms (`Overview`, `Acceptance`, `Boundaries / non-goals`, `Decision context`) and `flowctl validate` prints one `legacy spec headings` warning per such spec as the migration nudge. The R22 byte-for-byte skeleton baseline moved to the template itself, pinned by hash so a scaffold edit is always a deliberate bump. Template placeholder and example R-ID bullets now sit inside HTML comments, and every heading and R-ID scanner masks comments first, so a fresh CLI spec exports no phantom criteria. `flowctl prospect promote` still writes its own body shape and is a follow-up. (fn-220)

### Fixed

- **Renaming a spec no longer strands its branch name.** `flowctl spec set-title` renamed the id and files but left `branch_name` at the old slug, so a retitled spec silently dropped out of land's PR discovery and autonomous work named the wrong branch (caught by review on PR #395). A `branch_name` that still equals the old spec id (its create-time default) now follows the rename; any other value is kept, and the JSON result reports `branch_name` and `branch_rederived`.

## [flow-next 4.14.0] - 2026-09-04

Multi-task specs build faster by default: `/flow-next:work` now schedules on the rolling frontier, the architecture the experimental `/flow-next:work-rolling` beta proved in the field, and the beta itself is gone.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:work` schedules on the rolling frontier by default.** The next eligible task is admitted the moment any worker returns instead of waiting at wave barriers, each worker in an isolated workspace, with review and completion conductor-owned per task - the pre-registered fn-203 eval measured a 52.1% work-phase wall saving at quality parity, and the beta ran end-to-end on Claude Code, Cursor and Grok Build. Nothing to enable. The wave loop remains as the structural fallback, chosen from run and spec state alone: a task-id run (`work fn-N.M` runs exactly that task, never the spec's wider frontier), plan-sync on (`planSync.enabled` not `false` - its per-wave barrier is the existing fail-closed rule), fewer than two open tasks (a no-plan implicit task, or one task left), or a fully sequential dependency chain, where one lane runs with less machinery on the single-worker path. The route prints once during Phase 3, before the first task is claimed (the wave form at entry, the rolling form after the scheduler's dispatch probe), as `Scheduling: rolling` or `Scheduling: wave (<reason>)`; a host measured to block on dispatch still reports `degraded to wave`. Touches overlap is still judged per admission inside the scheduler, never at the route; there is no config knob and no host table. Pilot, land and Ralph dispatch plain work and inherit the route. (fn-218)

### Removed

- **`/flow-next:work-rolling` is gone.** The experimental beta graduated into work's default scheduler; its scheduler reference moved to `skills/flow-next-work/references/rolling-scheduler.md` and is read only on the rolling route. No alias: fn-203 recorded that exactly one topology survives graduation, and no autonomous driver ever named the beta. Repos that ran it invoke `/flow-next:work` instead. (fn-218)

## [flow-next 4.13.1] - 2026-09-03

Anyone running `/flow-next:pilot` and `/flow-next:land` unattended under a host loop gets two new controls over where the loop idles: pilot can open the draft PR in the same tick as a live QA verdict instead of paying an interval for a stage it was always going to run, and land can measure its merge wait from the bot's clean review instead of from the last push. Both are opt-in keys, off by default, and toggle independently; with either on, every gate, verdict, and merge license behaves exactly as before.

### Added

- **Pilot opens the draft PR in the same tick as the QA verdict instead of waiting for the next loop interval.** With `pipeline.chainStages` on (`flowctl config set pipeline.chainStages on`; a string-enum - only the literal `on` activates), a tick whose `qa` stage produced a fresh terminal verdict runs `make-pr` before it exits, so the driver no longer pays an interval plus a full re-anchor for a stage it was always going to run. The chain table is closed to that one row: `plan → plan-review` was found redundant at plan review, because pilot's plan dispatch already embeds its review loop and a successful plan tick already classifies `work` next; no transition that can fail into human territory chains. The terminal line reads `stage=qa+make-pr` with make-pr's verdict, `--dry-run` reports `chain=` and a precondition-checked `would-chain=`, a chained backlog tick writes one decision-log row per dispatched stage, and the PR stays a draft - pilot still never merges. Off (default), the tick is byte-for-byte unchanged; with `pipeline.qa` off there is nothing to chain.
- **Land's wait after a clean bot review becomes the repo's own review-anchored objection window.** With `land.patienceMinutesAfterReview` set (`flowctl config set land.patienceMinutesAfterReview 15`; any positive integer - `null` and `0` are off), the default `silence` gate measures its patience window from the head-current automated review event instead of from the last push, once that review has zero unresolved threads. The window is grace after the reviewer spoke, and it replaces the push window rather than taking the shorter of the two - so relative to today's wait an early review shortens it (a 30m push window, a review at push+1m, and a 15m after-review window merge at push+16m) and a late review lengthens it (a review at push+25m waits until push+45m); a fix push falls back to the push anchor until the bot re-reviews; the `approve`/`<login>` signals, every other window consumer, and the merge call are untouched. When configured, the report's `window=` field names the binding anchor (`anchor=<push|review>`); unset keeps today's report line byte-for-byte. (fn-219)

### Fixed

- **A GitHub outage during pilot's make-pr verification no longer counts as a failed stage.** The post-dispatch open-PR probe piped `gh` through `jq | head`, so a `gh` error or malformed response read as "no PR" and recorded a strike — two of them unready the spec. The probe now captures the `gh` exit status and makes `jq` the status-bearing command, so a probe failure is the crash-class `NEEDS_HUMAN` (no strike) that pilot already uses for its classification probe; a clean probe with no open PR is still the healthy-no-advance path. Applies to every make-pr tick, chained or not. (fn-219)

## [flow-next 4.13.0] - 2026-09-03

Anyone whose `.flow/memory/` keeps re-teaching the same lesson gets a third answer from `/flow-next:audit`: fix how the lesson is found, not what it says. Until now an entry that kept recurring but stated a rule no lint or CI step could check had nowhere to go - Harden needs a mechanizable rule, so the entry fell through to Keep and the next run re-learned it again. The audit now repairs that entry's retrieval surface instead of its wording, so the search that should have surfaced it does.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:audit` now fixes how a lesson is found, not just what it says.** A memory entry that keeps being re-learned but states a rule no lint or CI step can check used to fall through to Keep, so the same lesson got re-taught every run. The audit now classifies it as an Update with a retrieval fix: it repairs the entry's title, tags, module, and `applies_when` — and moves a misfiled entry into the category it belongs to, since a category-scoped search never reaches it where it sits — so the next search actually surfaces it. The retrieval rationale never licenses a body rewrite — but an entry that also carries plain reference drift still gets that repaired, on its own evidence, in the same Update. The report counts retrieval fixes inside Updated. No new status or field; the signal is the same write-side recurrence scan Harden already uses (fn-217).

## [flow-next 4.12.0] - 2026-09-02

Anyone running implementation review on the codex or host backend now gets most of a scope's findings in the first round instead of across a slow serial trickle. The first round draws three reviewers at once, each reading for a different defect class, and the coordinator hands back one merged list for a single fix pass. The round still counts once against the cap, the receipt records every draw honestly, and the topology is steerable in a sentence when a clean diff does not warrant the harvest.

### Added

- **Review findings arrive in one merged round instead of trickling out across many.** The first implementation-review round of a scope now fans out three concurrent draws of the same reviewer — one per axis lens: correctness-and-logic, contracts-and-consistency, integration-with-unchanged-code — and merges them into one consolidated finding set for a single fix pass. Two pre-registered studies showed why: single-pass review recall is stochastic sampling (each draw surfaces roughly 45% of the validated findings), and a union of three axis-differentiated draws recovers 1.56× single-draw recall — against a pre-registered 1.5× bar — at flat validity. Measured against historical rounds, this change is expected to dramatically shorten the iterative review churn — most of what previously surfaced across many serial rounds is available in the first merged round. The merged round consumes ONE review round against the cap, not three; re-reviews after fixes stay single-dispatch carrying the full merged finding container; SHIP gate, receipts, and every other fix-loop semantic are unchanged, and the merged receipt honestly records each draw. The harvest has known edges — a clean diff that would have shipped in one round pays roughly 3× review tokens for findings one draw would surface anyway, and roughly a third of validated findings eluded every draw in the studies, so round 2 shrinks rather than disappears. That is what the dial is for. The dial is prose, not configuration — reviews are optional to begin with, "use 1 reviewer instead of 3" collapses a round to a single draw when a clean diff doesn't warrant the harvest, and "use three different model families for the review fan-out" routes the draws cross-family for a high-stakes merge (worked recipes: `orchestration.md` and `running-lean.md`; a site cookbook page on steering the fan-out ships in the release-time downstream walk). Scope: the codex and host backends; rp keeps its single stateful chat, copilot and cursor keep single dispatch. Mechanically the fan-out is a two-phase flowctl surface — `codex impl-review-fanout` dispatches and `codex impl-review-fanout-finalize` records verdict, findings, receipt, and round atomically — with partial failures failing open from whichever draws returned a verdict. (fn-215) The workflows route every dispatch through one deterministic verb, `flowctl review-route`, which owns the canonical task id, the repo- and scope-keyed receipt path, receipt identity and verdict routing, stale rotation, and the task-mode fences - the prose branches on its action instead of re-deriving state in shell.

### Fixed

- **Implementation-review flags no longer vanish on zsh hosts.** The skill's argument parse used an unquoted shell loop that does not word-split under zsh, so `--validate`, `--deep`, and `--interactive` were silently dropped: the run completed as a plain review and reported success. Found by the release dogfood; the parse now splits under bash and zsh alike, verified with both. Other skills' parse fences are being audited separately.
- **`/flow-next:features` activates again on hosts with strict frontmatter parsing.** The skill's unquoted `description` contained a colon-space, which spec-compliant YAML parsers reject — the whole frontmatter block then silently dropped, leaving the skill installed but unmatchable (no description, no `allowed-tools`, no `user-invocable`). The description is now single-quoted, byte-identical otherwise; `claude plugin validate` passes. The only skill with the pattern. Thanks @acebytes for the report and the fix (#389, #390).

## [flow-next 4.11.0] - 2026-09-01

Anyone driving pilot over a mixed backlog can now mark an individual spec "too small to plan" and let the loop build it straight through — no more choosing between a blanket flag that mis-routed every spec a tick touched and hand-running the small ones yourself. The consent lives on the spec, where readiness already lives, so autonomous runs stay planned-by-default unless a human said otherwise.

### Changed

- **"Too small to plan" is now spec state, not an invocation flag.** A trivially small spec can be marked `no_plan` — at capture time (`/flow-next:capture ... --no-plan`) or any time later (`flowctl spec set-no-plan fn-N`) — and pilot builds it straight through the work stage's no-plan route once it's ready, alongside a backlog of normally planned specs. Before, the only signal was pilot's blanket `--no-plan` invocation flag, which applied to whatever spec the tick happened to select; that flag is gone (a stray `--no-plan` gets pilot's standard unknown-flag notice and the tick proceeds — affected zero-task specs simply route through plan, the safe default). The field is an explicit human instruction on the item, mirroring the `ready` flag's lazy contract exactly: absent reads false, every existing spec and workflow behaves identically, toggles are idempotent no-ops, and no autonomous path ever sets it. Setting is refused once a spec has tasks; a field left stale on a later-planned spec is inert by construction (pilot's zero-task classification never matches it; work ignores it with a one-line notice). `flowctl spec clear-no-plan` clears it any time, and direct `/flow-next:work fn-N --no-plan` keeps working unchanged. (fn-214)

## [flow-next 4.10.2] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **Captured specs stop putting words in the user's mouth.** `[user]` now means the tagged line is findable in the `## Conversation Evidence` block. A close restatement is `[paraphrase]`, never `[user]`. Capture's own process fences (new-vs-rewrite, ready-marking, "do not implement") can no longer masquerade as user-stated boundaries — evidence lines are user-typed only, an edit-cycle correction becomes evidence before redraft, split bodies verify findability against their own evidence slice, and section-level percentage notes never mint `[user]` authority for narrative sentences. Field-reported.

## [flow-next 4.10.1] - 2026-08-31

Unattended shipping and the new feature map both get sturdier: land now recognizes the clean verdict Codex actually posts today (including on repos that installed before this release), skills stop hand-rolling memory dedup, and the feature map stops fighting repo formatters.

### Added

- **Recurrence-deduped memory writes stop hand-rolling their own dedup.** `flowctl memory upsert` is a deterministic find-or-create: exact `--title` match within `--track` (byte-for-byte, no tokenization), creating on zero matches, updating in place on exactly one, and failing closed with the ids listed on two or more — never guessing. The QA feature-map-drift memo now uses one `upsert` call, replacing the fragile list+jq fold that drew a whole review-finding class during the feature-map work. Upsert is scoped to stable-title identities on purpose: the features maintain bug filing keeps the overlap-judged `add`-then-fold, because its free-form symptom titles carry no exact-title identity for upsert to match.

### Fixed

- **Unattended land no longer dead-ends on a clean Codex verdict in the new summary-table format.** Codex's PR-review bot now delivers a clean verdict as an edited-in-place summary comment (`**Code Review** | **Completed** ... <sha>`) instead of the "Didn't find any major issues. Reviewed commit" phrase, and `/flow-next:land`'s silence-signal comment scan could not see it — a fully converged PR stalled at `NEEDS_HUMAN: no automated review arrived within the patience window` and needed a manual merge (observed on PR #385). The built-in `land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` default now accepts both forms; the head-SHA and automated-reviewer gates are unchanged, so a stale row or unstructured "code review completed" prose still never satisfies the gate. Repos that installed earlier are covered too: the retired default materialized in `.flow/config.json` is auto-upgraded at read time (customized patterns and the explicit `""` off-switch are never touched).

- **The feature map no longer ships formatter-artifact commits.** In repos with a markdown formatter (pre-commit hook, `biome`, `oxfmt`, `prettier`), `/flow-next:features` seed and maintain now run it over the written `.flow/features/` files before finishing — first observed dogfooding on a real app, where table re-alignment forced two follow-up commits.

## [flow-next 4.10.0] - 2026-08-29

QA and drive keep how a user reaches each screen. Navigation, preconditions, and gotchas survive the run instead of evaporating, so the next pass starts from proven routes rather than rediscovering them.

### Added

- **Live verification stops paying the navigation tax every time.** A committed user-POV map at `.flow/features/` records how a user reaches each feature, how an agent drives it, and which traps waste a run. `/flow-next:qa` and `flow-next-drive` read it when it exists (existence check only; absent map is today's behavior). The spec still supplies this run's ACs, and live captured evidence remains the only SHIP basis. `/flow-next:features` seeds the map (every route proven by one live drive before it lands) and keeps it honest with an audit-shaped maintain pass: `clean`, `changed` (one PR of proven map/harness corrections, never product code), or `blocked`. Never a pipeline stage.

## [flow-next 4.9.1] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- **A workaround wearing a justifying comment no longer sails through code review as well-documented.** Implementation and standalone review now treat that comment as a signal on the underlying code. Severity is judged from the workaround, not the prose; rewriting or deleting the comment while keeping the hack does not resolve the finding. The fix is the code, or the constraint encoded as an assert, a test, or a lint rule. Licensed comments stay unflagged: license headers, external-constraint notes, lint suppressions with reasons, public API contracts, issue links.
- **Review bots can no longer hold a merge hostage on process ceremony.** Decisions recorded in a spec's Decision Context (or ruled by the maintainer on the PR) are settled: the plan-review and completion-review prompts gained the settled-decisions rule the impl-review prompt already carried, and all three now state that process-compliance observations — checklist ceremony, dogfood records, handoff paperwork — are FYI, never blocking. The recommended `land.reviewTrigger` text tells external bots the same. Conduct checklists remain review rubrics; the mandatory dogfood-and-record handoff step is removed from the maintainer docs.

## [flow-next 4.9.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Skipping the planning stage is now a first-class, recorded choice.** `/flow-next:work <spec-id>` on a spec with no tasks used to fall through to the completion gate and could end as a "successful" run that implemented nothing. It now forks explicitly: an interactive ask offers plan-first vs work-directly with the consequence of each stated, and the recommendation is judged per spec from size, independent surfaces, and blast radius — no static default. `--no-plan` (or plain language: "skip planning", "work directly") pre-answers the fork so the ask never fires when intent is stated; contradictory signals ask instead of guessing, and the flag on an already-planned spec is ignored with a one-line notice. The direct route mints exactly one minimal implicit task — "implement this spec", satisfying every R-ID, never an emulated plan — and runs the standard pipeline, so receipts, impl review, done evidence, and the single-task completion-review skip all compose unchanged. The minted task's worker carries a broad judicious-subagent license (parallel implementation, research, scouting — shape chosen by the harness at execution time, every subagent joined before commit). Autonomous runs never see the ask: without an explicit no-plan instruction a zero-task spec stops with a typed "spec has no tasks" report; pilot forwards an explicit `--no-plan` to its work dispatch and otherwise keeps routing zero tasks to plan; `flowctl next` surfaces the state as `status: plan, reason: needs_tasks` (Ralph stops typed instead of spinning); `/flow-next:work-rolling` refuses no-plan with the reason stated (a single implicit task degenerates the rolling frontier) and redirects to plain work. The routing surfaces know the route: it is the sixth worked variant in `pipeline-variations.md`, and guide, capture, and interview can now recommend it for near-zero-risk fully-known specs.

### Fixed

- **Three writing agents can dispatch subagents again.** The worker, pr-comment-resolver, and plan-sync agents carried a `disallowedTools: Task` denial from their first commit with no recorded rationale — Task is Claude Code's subagent-dispatch tool (renamed Agent in v2.1.63), not a planning feature, so the ban silently blocked dispatched workers from spawning scouts or parallel research. The audit removes it from the writers and keeps the denial on every read-only agent with the reason now written inline: a read-only agent that can spawn a writing subagent has an escape hatch out of read-only. Cursor and Grok parity confirmed; the OpenCode permission map and Codex sandbox follow automatically.

## [flow-next 4.8.0] - 2026-08-29

Autonomous loops stop failing quietly. This release hardens the prose contracts every autonomous run executes — the worker's implementation rules, the land conductor's merge and CI gates, and the review rubrics — closing failure classes banked from real overnight runs: budgets burned on stale state, gates trusted on narration instead of evidence, locks that outlive their tick, and cleanup that could sweep away work a human left uncommitted. The pass was itself pressure-tested: fourteen cross-model review rounds on the shipping PR forced twenty-nine further repairs before merge, so the rules below survived the exact kind of scrutiny they exist to impose.

### Changed

- **Autonomous runs stop trusting their own narration.** A hardening pass of roughly 34 short prose rules closes the failure classes the memory store had already banked: workers may never edit a test, gate, or baseline to make it pass, never weaken an assertion to match a wrong implementation, and record an errored or wrong-surface gate observation as inconclusive instead of green; a gate that passed suspiciously fast or collected zero cases gets its log checked before any green receipt is minted, so one false pass can no longer poison every later run that honors the receipt. The land conductor reads merge state and open threads before burning its CI-fix budget, re-gates a sibling PR after any merge, reclassifies a repeat identical failure instead of re-running it blind, honors spec dependencies at merge, and claims each tick atomically so overlapping ticks stop losing state. Wave dispatches now print their selection rule, carry an explicit path ban and a runtime cap with a return-partial contract, judge a silent lane by its side effects under the existing 2-strike cap, and only tear down a workspace whose commits are reachable and whose tree is clean. Reviews gain a named evidence scale (claimed / cited / walked / executed / reproduced), a structure-over-instruction probe, wire-type-leakage and legacy-dual-path checks, the shallow-module smell with its falsifiable sign, a mechanical 1000-line-crossing check capped at Should-Fix, and the pass-through smell in the impl-review baseline. Interview and plan answer empirically answerable forks with a throwaway probe instead of a question and treat wildly divergent independent opinions as an underspecified framing to reframe, never average; memory intake routes mechanizable lessons to gate proposals and fixes retrieval, not content, when an existing rule failed to fire. The in-review hardening went further: the land tick claim is owner-aware (a live tick is never reaped by the age threshold, an idle tick never leaves a lock behind, a session reclaims its own abandoned claim), CI flake signatures bind to the head they diagnosed so a fresh failure gets its own rerun, sibling PRs re-gate after any base-moving action rather than only a merge, and both the pause path and blocked-tree cleanup commit only what the run itself produced — pre-existing uncommitted work is left in place and named, never swept or reverted. Empirical probes carry a safety predicate: only non-mutating or disposable experiments run automatically; a stateful question falls back to asking. Deliberate baseline updates stay legal — the gate-manipulation ban targets edits that make a wrong implementation pass, not a pin update the task's acceptance names. Every touched conduct checklist learned its new rules, so the dogfood that reviews these skills now exercises the behavior it certifies.
- **The installed docs snippet now names the prose contract for chat replies.** 4.7.1 moved `/flow-next:prose` to the drafting moment, but the trigger stayed opportunistic — a host that never consulted its skill catalog could still ship a multi-section reply outside the contract. The CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md block that `/flow-next:setup` writes now carries a one-line standing instruction: invoke the prose skill before drafting any substantial reply; short conversational turns skip it. Snippet sentinel bumped to `v2`. Upgrade action: existing repos pick the line up on their next `/flow-next:setup` run (the Docs step proposes a marker-bounded refresh on content drift); nothing breaks unrefreshed.

## [flow-next 4.7.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:prose` now self-applies while the agent drafts, on every host.** The skill description was reshaped to the drafting moment - the agent reads the contract before writing a substantial reply, instead of waiting for a user phrase like "tighten this reply" - and Codex joins the ambient behavior: the skill enters the implicit catalog with a dieted drafting-moment entry (measured 2026-08-28, the global catalog sits under half the 8,000-char budget, so the earlier explicit-only carve-out was protecting headroom that was never at risk). Manual invocation with a draft to tighten is unchanged.

## [flow-next 4.7.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **The prose an agent ships now answers to a written contract.** PR bodies from make-pr, tracker comments from tracker-sync, and captured spec prose all read against one shipped reference, `plugins/flow-next/docs/prose.md`, so filler that could describe any project, feelings standing in for numbers, and invented outcome lines get caught at the moment of writing instead of in review. Coverage is now complete. Every durable emission surface carries the same one-line pointer (non-blocking - a host without the doc proceeds unchanged), spanning interview spec write-backs, resolve-pr replies, plan and task specs, chart briefings, strategy sections, qa finding bodies, land verdict comments, prospect candidates, prime glossary definitions, audit memory entries, and worker done summaries, alongside the original make-pr, tracker-sync, and capture points. The doc's precedence rule keeps every structural contract authoritative (tracker dedup markers stay first-line and byte-unchanged, projection-only source truth is never overridden, outcome-first ordering never invents an outcome), and the repo's changelog writing gate is now an explicitly labeled specialization of the same contract. The scope stays honest - artifact prose only, with no claim about code quality (SlopCodeBench, arXiv 2603.24755, is cited for exactly what it shows). Under the hood, the codex mirror's docs-link rewrite and hard-fail link guard now cover `agents/*.md`, so agent-file pointers mirror to resolvable paths instead of shipping dangling. A new `/flow-next:prose` skill extends the same contract to substantial chat replies, opportunistically and description-triggered rather than guaranteed; the visual digest stays excluded.

## [flow-next 4.6.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Cursor and Grok Build now roll instead of self-degrading to waves.** The rolling scheduler's portable-host clause named both hosts as blocking-dispatch by assumption; a five-minute dispatch probe on each disproved it (control returned before completion, per-completion notifications, and a full end-to-end rolling run on a blind three-task fixture — Cursor on macOS and Grok Build 1.0.5 via `spawn_subagent` background mode, both 2026-08-27). The clause and the platforms matrix now bind on measured dispatch behavior with dated provenance, never on host name; a genuinely blocking host still degrades honestly to wave scheduling, unchanged.

## [flow-next 4.6.0] - 2026-08-27

Autonomous runs stop wedging on reviews that were never going to happen, and stop paying for reviews that already did. A completion review a policy deliberately excused is now a recorded, first-class state every gate honors, so excused specs close and ship instead of looping; reviewers get a stated verification budget, so a review round re-checks what the finding disputes instead of re-running the whole suite the run's final gate already owns. Land's post-merge bookkeeping survives its own ignore rules, dead-end review modes are refused before any work happens, and OpenCode users can finally run every command a closer prints.

### Added

- **Review rounds stop re-running the world.** Both reviewer prompts (impl-review and spec-completion-review) now carry a verification-budget rail: a round verifies via the Quick commands of the spec (or task) under review and the focused suites its evidence or dispatch names, plus any command a specific finding needs; the full suite belongs to the run's final gate, never to a review round. Observed trigger: a re-reviewer on a rolling run chose a full serial `unittest discover` on the conductor's critical path, tripling the round's wall time with verification the quiesce gate already owned. The rail ships in the prompt templates, their byte-identical flowctl fallbacks, and one pointer line per host dispatch block; token deltas are recorded measurements now, never an enforced ceiling.

### Fixed

- **Policy-skipped completion reviews no longer wedge the pipeline** (#371 — thanks @sn-furali). When work's 3g gate skips the completion review by policy, it now records the decision as `completion_review_status: not_required` — "requirement satisfied, no review ran" — instead of leaving `unknown`, which every gate read as "nobody looked". The excused spec now closes cleanly everywhere it used to loop: the tracker projection accepts `--to done` for a merged excused spec (terminal label stays `done`; `verified` still requires a real SHIP), `flowctl next --require-completion-review` stops re-requesting the review, pilot no longer re-routes the spec to `work` every tick, and Ralph's completion gate terminates. Every gate decides through one satisfying set, `{ship, not_required}`; unrecognized values still fail closed as `unknown`, and the skip writes via compare-and-set from `unknown`, so a real verdict is never silently overwritten. The excuse also un-arms itself when it stops being true: adding a task, rewriting the plan, editing a task's contract, or resetting a task flips `not_required` back to `unknown` (real verdicts untouched), and the write itself refuses a surface that is no longer single-task.
- **Land's post-merge sync-state commit no longer dies on the receipts directory** (#367 — thanks @sn-furali). The tail's `git add` named the auto-ignored `.flow/sync-runs/` alongside the tracked spec sidecar, so the add failed and the sidecar was left staged or unstaged depending on whether the directory existed. The pathspec now names only the tracked sidecar, and the commit is guarded on a staged diff — an unchanged sidecar (including a resume-tail re-entry over an already-committed one) is success with nothing to commit.
- **Work no longer offers a review mode that can never reach a verdict** (#366). Work and work-rolling advertised an export review mode that impl-review could never run to a SHIP verdict. The roster now drops `export` at every mouth — work's advertised surfaces and impl-review's own parser — and an explicit request is refused at parse time with a pointer to `/flow-next:plan-review --review=export`, where export actually lives.
- **OpenCode users can now run the commands the closers print** (#364). Skill closers printed `/flow-next:<name>` while OpenCode's invocable form is the flat `/flow-next-<name>`. Every closer that prints a copy-pasteable next-step command now emits the flat form on an OpenCode install (detected via the ownership manifest, no new probe) and keeps the documented colon form on every other host; the Codex mirror's rewrite guard gained a positive expected-output check so a reworded closer literal fails the sync instead of silently staling the mirror.

## [flow-next 4.5.1] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **Plan-sync becomes opt-in.** Fresh installs no longer pay a reconciliation pass after every completed task: on most specs the auto-dispatched pass finds nothing to change, and manual `/flow-next:sync` keeps the full capability for the moment a task genuinely invalidates a downstream assumption. `flowctl init` now seeds `planSync.enabled: false` and the merged default answers `false` for an absent key; existing configs keep whatever they have, and setup still asks the question with the trade-off explained. A welcome side effect: the rolling-frontier beta's prerequisite (`planSync.enabled=false`) is now the default state, so a fresh repo can invoke `/flow-next:work-rolling` directly. Opt back in with `flowctl config set planSync.enabled true`.

## [flow-next 4.5.0] - 2026-08-22

Multi-task runs stop paying for the wave barrier: an opt-in beta scheduler starts the next task the moment any worker finishes, cutting work-phase wall-clock by half in its pre-registered eval while every review gate, receipt, and quality check stays exactly as strict. The architecture was chosen by evidence, and the eval's most useful output is the arm it rejected.

### Added

- **Experimental rolling-frontier work beta: `/flow-next:work-rolling`.** A user-invoked beta variant of `/flow-next:work` that admits a new ready task the moment any in-flight task returns, instead of waiting at wave boundaries - isolated per-task workspaces, conductor-owned review at every return event, and a shared outside-tree run-notes surface workers read by pointer. Same inputs as `/flow-next:work`; pilot, land, and Ralph never dispatch it. Prerequisite: plan-sync must be off (`flowctl config set planSync.enabled false` - `true` is the shipped default) or the run fail-closes to serial, canonical behavior. Architecture picked by the fn-203 pre-registered three-arm eval (rolling + isolated workspaces won: 52.1% work-phase wall saving at quality parity, zero uncontained correctness incidents). Why worktrees and not a shared checkout: the faster shared-checkout arm failed quality parity for a measurable reason - making the declared-paths list the commit boundary structurally incentivized workers toward fewer test files (tests are the artifact that spawns new files), and constrained verify windows made test iteration costly; the per-task worktree pool removes both pressures, so speed never gets bought with under-testing. **Experimental and opt-in** - the scheduler may evolve as it matures; canonical `/flow-next:work` is unchanged. Details: `plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md`, `plugins/flow-next/docs/troubleshooting.md`.

## [flow-next 4.4.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Capture and plan now tell you the smallest sufficient next step, right when you choose it.** Both closers print one `Recommended next:` line — a route judged from the spec you just wrote (open unknowns → interview, real design risk → plan, near-zero risk → a minimal plan with plan-review typically ceremony) or the plan you just decomposed (plan-review vs straight to work, with review skips reserved for the two documented ceremony shapes). One advisory sentence with a reason and an alternative; the familiar menu stays untouched below it, and autonomous runs are unchanged.

## [flow-next 4.3.1] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Review-fix test runs stop being paid for twice.** When a fix loop's post-fix
  test run passes the repo's full-gate command at the committed fix HEAD, it now
  writes the same green receipt the work pipeline already honors — so the later
  Verify skips the identical re-run instead of repeating 2–10 minutes of tests it
  can prove already passed. Fail-closed: focused suites never mint a full-gate
  receipt, and any doubt means the gate re-runs as today.
- **Subsequent tasks inherit a proven-green baseline.** On a multi-task run the
  conductor may hand worker N+1 a `BASELINE_HANDOFF` when task N's Verify just
  proved the same Quick commands green and nothing relevant moved — the worker
  records the provenance and skips re-proving it. The first task's baseline always
  runs (it catches local-environment failures CI can't see), lint always runs, and
  red-baseline detection is unchanged.

## [flow-next 4.3.0] - 2026-08-21

OpenCode joins the first-class harness roster. If OpenCode is your daily driver,
you install flow-next once from the canonical repo, run setup like everyone else,
and get the full pipeline - planning fan-outs, cross-model reviews, receipts -
riding every release from day one. The separate community port (seven releases
stale) is superseded and archived.

### Added

- **OpenCode is a first-class harness.** OpenCode has no plugin format, so
  `./scripts/install-opencode.sh` scatters the canonical files into
  `~/.config/opencode/`: skills as-is, the plugin-root support dirs at the config
  root (the existing flowctl/template resolution works with zero prose changes),
  agents generated with byte-identical bodies and `disallowedTools` translated to
  OpenCode's `permission:` deny map (pinned against opencode.ai/config.json), and
  flat `/flow-next-<name>` command stubs. A deterministic ownership manifest
  scopes every re-run, deletion, and `--uninstall` to installed paths only - a
  colliding user directory aborts the install rather than being deleted, and
  generation fails closed on any denial it cannot represent. Verified live on
  opencode 1.18.19: 29/29 skills and 20/20 subagents discovered with correct
  permission maps, a full `/flow-next-plan` scout fan-out, and a codex-backend
  plan review driven end-to-end from an OpenCode session.
- **Setup runs on OpenCode like every other host.** The installer's ownership
  manifest doubles as setup's platform-detection signal (a positive rung ordered
  before the codex fallback), so `/flow-next-setup` writes AGENTS.md instructions
  in the flat slash form instead of falling through to Codex-shaped snippets.
- **Host-backend review works on OpenCode - and the host backend got a hard
  rule everywhere.** OpenCode subagents take their model from their own agent
  definition or inherit the session model; there is no dispatch-time override.
  Pinning a tier's model is one 5-line user agent file (recipe in
  `docs/reach/opencode.md`) - verified live: the conductor matched the routing
  block's reviewer model to the pinned roster agent unhinted, the harness honored
  it, and the receipt recorded the real reviewer. Without a pin, the degraded
  reviewer self-reports and the review fail-closes instead of letting the session
  model grade its own work. New critical rule in all three host workflows,
  every harness: `host` never shells out to another CLI - a `codex exec` inside
  a host review is a broken run; the CLI backends exist for that.

## [flow-next 4.2.2] - 2026-08-20

Runs finish sooner without touching what reviews check: small specs stop paying a
duplicate review, multi-task waves stop paying repeated plan-sync passes, and plans
that could run their tasks in parallel stop silently running them one by one. First
batch of fixes from a measured wall-clock pass over the whole pipeline.

### Changed

- **Single-task specs stop paying a second review of the same diff.** The completion
  review gate now skips when a spec has exactly one task whose per-task impl-review
  already reached SHIP and every spec requirement is covered by that task — recorded
  as an explicit skip line, never a silent absence. Multi-task specs keep the full
  completion review (its cross-task integration value is the point). Typical saving:
  one full backend review round per small spec. Also aligns the work skill's
  documented gate contract with what actually runs.
- **Plan-sync runs once per wave instead of once per task.** After a resolved wave,
  one plan-sync agent now reconciles every completed task against the downstream
  set in a single pass — same scope, same per-task drift verdicts and stage lines,
  k× fewer dispatches on multi-task waves.
- **Plan review now flags a missing `Touches:` line, not just implausible ones.**
  Omitting the line silently forces serial dispatch (waves are fail-closed on it);
  on a multi-task spec a dep-independent task without it is now a review finding.
  Pilot's evidence echo also repeats the work stage's `Sequential fallback:` reason,
  so a driver loop can see when a spec ran serial and why.
- **Parallel agents in sibling worktrees: shared claim state documented.** flowctl's
  runtime state store lives in the git common dir and is shared by every worktree —
  docs and the worktree-kit skill now say so and point at the `FLOW_STATE_DIR`
  override (set it outside the repo tree).

## [flow-next 4.2.1] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **Setup now tells you what each opt-in costs before you answer.** The review-backend
  question says where the time goes (each review round is a serial pass the pipeline
  waits on - usually the largest wall-clock item in a run), the `None` option spells
  out what still gates a run without reviews and what stops being checked, and every
  Claude Code / Droid / Codex install can now pick `Host` from the menu - the
  host-native reviewer that keeps every review gate with no second CLI, configured by
  one `reviewer:` line in the routing block. The memory, plan-sync, GitHub-scout, and
  HTML-artifact questions carry the same one-line cost shape. The full dial from a
  cross-model backend down to `host` or `none` is priced in the Running Lean doc.

## [flow-next 4.2.0] - 2026-08-19

Teams whose merge gate is a human - a code-owner review required by a ruleset,
sharpest when the PR author is a GitHub App that cannot be a code owner - no
longer watch a converged PR sit idle until someone happens to notice it. Land
now tells the right person it is their turn, at the one moment that is true.

### Added

- **The human reviewer is asked when - and only when - their review is the last
  thing between the PR and a merge.** Before, `/flow-next:land` could summon a
  bot, bound its wait, and decide what counts as a clean review, but it never
  populated the PR's requested-reviewers field: a converged PR reported
  `AWAITING_REVIEW` / `NEEDS_HUMAN` and the one person who could satisfy the
  gate was never told. With the new opt-in `land.requestReviewers` (a csv of
  GitHub logins and/or `org/team` slugs and/or the literal `codeowners`), the
  tick that finds CI green, zero unresolved threads, and a human review as the
  sole missing merge input flips a draft PR to ready - so "ready" keeps meaning
  "a human may review this now" - and requests the listed reviewers minus the
  PR author (`codeowners` rides the ready flip; GitHub resolves the owners
  itself, no local CODEOWNERS parsing). The ask happens once per PR per head
  SHA, recorded in the land ledger and claimed atomically so overlapping ticks
  cannot double-request; a land-authored CI-fix push moves the head and re-asks
  only if the human's review is again missing - a genuine re-request, not spam.
  A failed request records the head anyway (one attempt, no retry loop) and
  surfaces `reviewers=failed:<reason>` with the window-bounded verdict, never
  `BLOCKED`. The key never gates a merge - `land.reviewSignal` still does; a
  team that wants a human look on every PR sets `reviewSignal: approve`.
  `--dry-run` reports `action=request-reviewers reviewers=would-request` (plus
  `would-ready` for a draft) and mutates nothing. Default `""` (unset / `null`
  / `""` all mean off; a configured key whose moment has not come reports
  `skipped:not-due`, so `off` always means "not configured"): every existing
  gate, action, and ledger write is unchanged, and the evidence line gains one
  additive field,
  `reviewers=<requested|would-request|already:<sha8>|skipped:<reason>|failed:<reason>|off>`,
  alongside the new `action=request-reviewers` value. Under the hood: a
  read-only `§2.6b` predicate in the gate tree, the Phase 3 action class
  `§3.4b — request-reviewers` (atomic `mkdir` claim → head re-read → ready
  flip → author-filtered `gh pr edit --add-reviewer` → ledger
  `reviewRequestSha`), the `author` field on the PR state capture, and the key
  published in `flow-config.schema.json`. Part 2 of the report
  (`land.draftOnChangesRequested`) is deferred until part 1 has shipped. Thanks
  @sn-furali for the report (#359).

## [flow-next 4.1.0] - 2026-08-17

Teams running pilot from git worktrees, or opening one PR per gate on a reused
branch, stop hitting `NEEDS_HUMAN` walls that were built for a different repo
shape; tracker consumers get a read-only answer to "which workflow states
exist" that cannot touch their config; and a review round that fails to
deliver a verdict can no longer wedge a spec's reviews. Three of the four
changes are verified field reports from @sn-furali (#354, #355, #356); the
fourth was found dogfooding this release's own review pipeline.

### Added

- **Ask a tracker which workflow states exist - without risking your config.**
  `flowctl tracker wire list-states [--json]` (Linear + Jira) enumerates the
  destination's workflow states read-only, so consumers can answer "does every
  configured state id still name a live state?" without building a second
  tracker client - and without `tracker resolve`, whose job is to repair and
  *write* `tracker.resolved` (in one reported case moving a hand-picked
  `stateIds.done` off the team's chosen state). Output is the exhaustive
  `{"states": [{"id","name","type"}], "complete": bool}` shape: `complete`
  provably distinguishes a full listing from a truncated one (a truncated
  listing returns the partial states with `complete: false` and exit 0 - the
  caller decides to refuse), a malformed or id-less state node is a typed
  transport error on both providers rather than a silently shrunken list, and
  GitHub/GitLab - which have no workflow-state pool - return a typed
  capability error instead of an invented projection. No code path writes
  `.flow/config.json` or any `.flow/` file. Thanks @sn-furali for the report
  (#356).

### Fixed

- **Pilot now composes with git worktrees.** Pilot's `plan` / `plan-review`
  stages hard-required checking out the default branch - but git allows a
  branch in exactly one worktree, so following the Worktree Kit's own
  one-worktree-per-spec guidance killed every tick with `NEEDS_HUMAN` before
  dispatch. The branch matrix now enforces the property the old rule was
  standing in for: never write planning state onto a branch with an open PR.
  No open PR on the current branch (a fresh worktree branch, or the default
  branch itself): stay and dispatch. Open PR: fall back to the default-branch
  checkout, and report `NEEDS_HUMAN` (naming the branch and reason) only when
  that fallback fails. A failed PR probe degrades to the checkout attempt -
  fail-safe, never planning onto an unknown-status branch. Thanks @sn-furali
  for the report (#354).
- **Reused branches with merged gate PRs no longer dead-end pilot.** The
  all-done classification treated any MERGED PR on a still-open spec as
  `NEEDS_HUMAN` - contradicting make-pr's own rule that closed/merged PRs on a
  reused branch must not trigger refusal, and stranding teams that open one PR
  per gate (capture, plan, plan-review, then work). Pilot now uses head
  identity: merged PRs with unshipped commits on the branch (branch head
  differs from the newest merged PR's `headRefOid`) classify as
  make-pr-eligible; `NEEDS_HUMAN` is kept exactly when the branch head equals
  the newest merged PR head - a merged PR with nothing new and an open spec is
  the genuinely inconsistent state. Head identity, not ancestry counting, on
  purpose: land squash-merges, so an ancestry count would read fully-shipped
  work as unshipped. A missing `headRefOid` or rev-parse failure keeps today's
  `NEEDS_HUMAN`. Thanks @sn-furali for the report (#355).
- **A failed review round can no longer wedge every future review of that
  spec.** When a review backend returned no parseable verdict, flowctl
  correctly refunded the round - but left behind a finalization journal whose
  bookkeeping could never complete (receipt publication and findings attach
  are reserved for delivered verdicts, by design). Every later dispatch on
  that scope then refused with `REPLAY_REQUIRED`, and even
  `flowctl spec reset-review-rounds` could not clear it - the only way out was
  hand-editing `.flow` state. A refunded round now finishes its own
  bookkeeping on the spot (the attempt ledger remains the full record of the
  refund; no receipt is fabricated for a verdict that never arrived), and
  repos already carrying a wedged journal from an earlier version self-heal on
  their next review dispatch. Found dogfooding this release's own review
  pipeline.

### Docs

- **Pipeline variations — pick stages by risk and unknowns, never by size.** A new
  [`docs/pipeline-variations.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/pipeline-variations.md)
  walks five worked routes through the menu — full epic (capture the whole epic,
  interview to sharpen the inferred lines), feature-with-known-requirements,
  small task, bug fix (reproduction, not conversation, is the sharpening tool),
  and docs/chore via the triage-skip receipt. It names the real selector — what's
  unknown, what breaks if we're wrong, who needs the record — frames
  prospect/chart as upstream discovery your organization has often already done
  under another name, and states what holds on every route: evidence JSON on
  `done`, gates and receipts, recorded `skipped(reason)` entries, and a review
  artifact scaled to the risk. The variants are worked examples, not tiers.

## [flow-next 4.0.0] - 2026-08-15

Install the plugin once - your repos need nothing else, ever again. 4.0.0
retires the copied-files install layout: `flowctl`, the agent guide, and the
spec template no longer land as snapshots in your repo, every host resolves the
CLI from the plugin install itself, and a plugin update never requires
re-running setup in any project again. Repos with old copies keep working
untouched - and can simply delete them.

In the same release, choosing which model does what becomes something you say,
not something you
configure. Routing is a short block of your own words in your own
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` - four named tiers, filled with model names you can
verify against your own account - and every session, including unattended
pilot, land, and Ralph ticks, already reads it and applies it with judgment.
Gone with the machinery: the probe-and-pin ceremony setup used to run, the
per-backend role map, and the packaged codex-delegation subsystem. Configure
routing once, in your file, in your words - and stop paying for our model lists
going stale. If you never routed anything, nothing changes: every tier falls
back to the session model, exactly as flow-next has always run out of the box.

### BREAKING

- **Packaged codex delegation is gone.** Removed: the six `work.delegate*`
  config keys (`delegate`, `delegateConsent`, `delegateDecision`,
  `delegateEffort`, `delegateModel`, `delegateSandbox`), the `models.roles.delegate`
  role pin, the `delegate:codex` / `delegate:local` work arguments, the work
  skill's delegation gating and result-classification path, the
  `flowctl codex classify-result` / `codex rollback-plan` subcommands, and the
  `/flow-next:setup` "Scaffold + enable codex delegation" option. Nothing in the
  standard work loop changes - it was off by default, and the host already owned
  gating, git, review, and commit.

  **Migration (one step):** run `/flow-next:setup` and accept the model-routing
  scaffold, then drive the other CLI with the bridge recipes in `flowctl usage`
  (§ Orchestration & model steering). Leftover `work.delegate*` keys in
  `.flow/config.json` are inert; flowctl prints one non-blocking advisory naming
  them and the replacement route until you delete them. Two rules carry over and
  are not optional: **the bridged child writes code while the host keeps git,
  judgment, and the verdict**, and on well-specified work a value-tier
  implementer matches a strong-tier one at roughly two-thirds the wall clock -
  send clear tasks to the value tier, escalate the gnarly ones. Details:
  [`docs/orchestration.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md#implementation-offload--the-bridge-route).

- **The model-pin ceremony and the role map are gone.** Setup no longer asks
  which model should play which role, no longer probes a CLI for the ids it
  serves, and no longer records what it found: the `models.roles` role map and
  its `models.verifiedAt` / `models.verifiedWith` staleness stamps are removed,
  along with the role-map validation that ran on write. Config that claimed
  what was installed became config that lied - a model id is a property of your
  machine and your account, not of a project.

  **Migration (one step):** run `/flow-next:setup`, which writes a routing block
  into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` with every line commented out, then fill in the
  tiers you care about. Leftover `models.*` keys in `.flow/config.json` are
  inert - flowctl names them once in a non-blocking advisory and keeps running.
  Nothing fails closed on routing, ever: a model this harness cannot reach falls
  back to the session model, says so once, and continues.

- **`flowctl setup-mode` is gone**, along with the plugin/copy mode question.
  There is one setup mode now, so there is nothing to stamp or switch. Existing
  `setup_mode` / `setup_version` values in `.flow/meta.json` are tolerated as
  inert metadata and never read; a script that called `flowctl setup-mode set`
  can simply drop the call.

### Added

- **Four tier names, so you can state intent instead of wiring mechanism.**
  `reviewer` (anything grading someone else's work - prefer a different family
  than the writer), `implementer` (work handed to another harness), `fast scout`
  (mechanical inventory scanning), `thinking scout` (analysis that degrades on a
  fast tier), and unset - the default and the majority: planning, capture,
  interview, every verdict, and the worker stay on the session model. A tier
  says which model executes a stage, never which stages run. Defined in exactly
  one place, [`docs/orchestration.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md#tiers--what-kind-of-model-a-job-wants),
  and carried in the repo glossary with the synonyms to avoid. Enable: nothing -
  write `<tier>: <model>` (optionally `at <effort>`) in your instruction file.

- **A reach page per harness, so "can I even do that here?" has an answer.**
  [`docs/reach/`](plugins/flow-next/docs/reach/README.md) states, for each
  supported harness, which mechanisms exist (in-session model, in-host subagent,
  another CLI over a bridge), which do not, and what the degradation is when one
  is missing - and tells you to ask the harness for its model list rather than
  trust a stored answer. Skills ask for a tier and name no spawn primitive, CLI
  flag, or vendor path; an undetectable harness resolves to the generic page and
  says so.

- **Routing is checkable after the fact.** Where the harness exposes it, a stage
  records the model that actually ran, so a routing preference expressed in prose
  leaves evidence instead of a hope. Unavailable provenance is recorded as
  unknown - never as the configured value.

### Changed

- **Setup no longer copies anything into your repo, so plugin updates need no
  per-repo action.** Previously most repos ran in "copy mode": `flowctl`, the
  agent guide, and the spec template landed as snapshots under `.flow/`, and
  every plugin update meant re-running `/flow-next:setup` in each project or
  silently running an old CLI. Now every host resolves `flowctl` from the plugin
  install itself - Claude Code and Droid through their plugin-root env vars,
  Codex through `$CODEX_HOME`, and Cursor and Grok by deriving the plugin root
  from the absolute skill path those hosts already hand the agent. Update the
  plugin and you are done. `/flow-next:setup` is now only for the first run, a
  configuration change, or the rare release that says the docs-snippet schema
  bumped.

  **Migration: delete your copies.** `.flow/bin/`, `.flow/templates/spec.md`,
  and `.flow/usage.md` are dead weight on every host - nothing reads them, and
  removing them changes nothing observable in any workflow. `/flow-next:setup`
  offers to delete them for you (never silently), and `/flow-next:plan` prints a
  one-line nudge when it sees them. Keeping them is the riskier choice: a stale
  copied `flowctl` can shadow the current one. If you have not migrated yet,
  nothing breaks - skills still fall back to `.flow/bin/flowctl` as a silent
  backstop.

- **Reviewer and auditor subagents carry an explicit working-tree conduct rule** - read-only means the shell too: no `git checkout`/`restore`/`clean`/`stash`, no shell file writes; surprising uncommitted state is reported as a finding, never "repaired". Added after a live incident where an auditor's `git restore` destroyed another agent's uncommitted review state.

- **Resolution is one sentence at every dispatch site**, not a resolver:
  an explicit instruction in the moment, then your routing block, then the agent
  definition's own default, then the session model. Agent `model:` fields keep
  working as that third rung - the floor - so a repo with no routing block
  behaves exactly as it always has.

- **Shipped prose no longer names models.** The identifiers scattered through
  the docs, skills, and templates (179 of them across 64 files, doubled by the
  generated Codex mirror) are gone, with two deliberate exceptions: the single
  orchestration reference page that explains what each tier is for, and the
  `review.backend` configuration grammar, which is untouched by this release and
  keeps its own precedence, receipts, and round counting.

## [flow-next 3.34.0] - 2026-08-14

Autonomous merges get three long-requested capabilities, and land loses its
most dangerous power. A repo whose branch protection excludes the tick's
human identity can now hand just the merge to an App or bot
(`FLOW_PR_MERGE_CMD`, the merge-side counterpart of 3.11.0's
`FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD`). A PR that fell behind its base catches up server-side
- land never rebases and never force-pushes again, which also removes the
CAUSE of orphaned evidence commits that 3.26.0 could only detect. And a base
that requires pull requests no longer breaks the post-merge lifecycle: the
board update and the release run before the one push that can fail. Fixes
#337, #342, and the lifecycle half of #345 - thanks @sn-furali for all
three, each verified claim-by-claim.

### Added

- **`FLOW_PR_MERGE_CMD`** - env-only (deliberately never a `land.*` key: the
  §2.9 trust guard exists because config-sourced command strings are
  PR-author-influenceable; session env is not), with a STABLE contract:
  fixed argument order, stderr proxied verbatim (the RESOLVING/BLOCKED split
  reads gh's head-mismatch text), never `--auto`, merge-call-only scope.

### Changed

- **The `rebase` action class is now `catch-up`, and it is server-side.**
  One `gh pr update-branch` call replaces checkout + rebase +
  force-push; GitHub's own conflict refusal is the BLOCKED verdict; commit
  SHAs survive, so recorded evidence stays reachable. BEHIND and DIRTY both
  route here. §2.6/§2.7 evaluation order under `reviewSignal: approve` is
  now stated explicitly (the stale-approval detector is reachable; the
  durable label is what breaks the dismissal loop).
- **Post-merge tail: close -> release-follow -> tracker -> persist-push.**
  A refused push to a PR-only base now costs a bookkeeping note instead of
  a stuck board and a skipped release. The close-PR route (#345's part B)
  is deliberately held pending residual need.

When a permissions problem breaks tracker sync, you now find out in
milliseconds with the actual cause - the path, the errno, and what to fix -
instead of waiting out a 10-second stall and being told a phantom "holder
appears alive". And when you ask which model reviewed your code, the attempt
ledger can finally answer: rows record the model and effort that actually
ran, which no config re-derivation could reconstruct after the fact. Fixes
#340 - thanks @TechupBusiness for the measured report (your self-reentrancy
hypothesis was disproven by a call-graph sweep; the real cause was a
swallowed PermissionError). Addresses the model-recording half of #338 -
thanks @sn-furali.

### Fixed

- **`config_lock` reports what it observed.** A lock that can never be
  created (denied `mkdir`, path absent) fails fast with errno + path instead
  of burning the deadline; timeouts compose the message from observations -
  owner facts when read, owner-absent + when-it-reclaims when not; "holder
  appears alive" is reserved for an actually-observed owner. The Windows
  pending-delete poll is preserved; no lock semantics changed.

### Added

- **Review-attempt rows record the resolved model/effort.** Conditional keys,
  present only where the dispatcher resolved them (never "unknown"), sourced
  from the same values the receipt records, journaled and crash-replayed.
  The rp/host record path deliberately cannot claim a model.

`flowctl validate` could not pass on a fresh clone: task status is
runtime-only and never travels with git, so every done spec's tasks read as
`todo` from the committed snapshot and the epic/task mismatch rule failed the
run - 582 structurally-guaranteed false errors on this repo's own clone, and
the work skill's Phase 5 verify step was red on any spec closed on another
machine. And `flowctl done` writes its receipt into the tracked task file
AFTER the loop's documented commit, silently - the final task's summary never
reached any other checkout. Fixes #346 and #347 - thanks @sn-furali for
identifying both halves of the durability-boundary contract break.

### Fixed

- **Fresh-clone `validate` is meaningful again.** The epic/task status
  mismatch downgrades to a warning when the status came from the committed
  snapshot with no runtime progress markers (a fresh clone); runtime-sourced
  mismatches, and legacy repos whose tracked definition carries real
  progress, stay errors. Exit code still gates on errors only.
- **`done`/`block` name the tracked file they wrote.** The `--json` payload
  gains `modified_paths` and one stderr advisory fires when the receipt
  leaves a tracked file dirty - flowctl never stages or commits; it names the
  path and the caller decides. The documented loop ordering is now canonical
  across all three surfaces (worker agent, usage template, quickstart):
  commit the work, `done`, then stage the receipt.

## [flow-next 3.33.0] - 2026-08-14

When a spec's tasks are genuinely independent, flow-next can implement them at
the same time - and it has, but far less often than it should. The rule that
decides a concurrent wave is fail-closed on a per-task declaration of the paths
that task will modify, and the planning guidance told authors to leave that line
out whenever it was hard to predict. Taken at its word, that turned a default
into an exception: specs whose tasks would have run side by side ran one after
the other instead, because nothing had declared what they touch. This release
makes the declaration standard rather than optional, fixes two things that break
a wave when the declarations are there, and writes down what it is worth: two
independent tasks that took 187 seconds one after the other took 96 seconds side
by side, with no extra tokens - the same work, overlapped rather than repeated.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent task waves are the default now, not the exception - their
  precondition was written as an opt-out and went under-authored.** A wave
  dispatches only when every task in it declares the paths it will modify, and
  the planning guidance said to leave that line out whenever it was hard to
  predict. How often waves fired therefore came down to how boldly each planning
  pass read that advice; in this repository's own recent history not one task
  carried the line, so its runs stayed sequential regardless of how independent
  the tasks were. Planning now writes the line on every task, and says to declare
  wider rather than omit when uncertain:
  a too-wide declaration keeps the tasks serial, which is exactly what omitting
  did, while a declared one can actually become a wave. Getting it wrong stays
  cheap by construction - workers write in isolated workspaces, so an overlap
  surfaces as a merge conflict at the join and costs one serial re-run, never
  correctness.
- **Two things that break a wave are now stated where the conductor reads
  them** - both found by running the path end to end before shipping this. A wave workspace is branched from a commit, so a freshly planned spec
  that has not been committed yet does not exist inside it and every parallel
  worker fails to re-anchor - looking like a broken worker rather than a missing
  commit. And a worker's handover evidence names commits that live only on its
  own workspace branch: recording those unchanged leaves each finished task
  pointing at commits that vanish with the workspace, which `flowctl validate`
  then reports as orphaned. Both are now preconditions in the work phases and
  the join reference, pinned by tests, with the second carrying its own failure
  signature.

### Docs

- **Troubleshooting gains the wave-join merge conflict entry** - what it means
  when concurrent workers were green in isolation but the join conflicts (the
  declarations overlapped in reality), what to do (resolve, re-run the affected
  task serially, correct the declarations), and why nothing was corrupted.

## [flow-next 3.32.2] - 2026-08-13

On Cursor, the in-IDE browser was documented as a last-resort curiosity with invented tool names, so agents skipped a driver that actually works. Probe it by id, recover from a mid-run drop, and do not treat a catalog miss as absence.

### Fixed

- **Agents on Cursor can drive the in-IDE browser instead of skipping it.** The old reference invented `browser_console_messages`, omitted `browser_select_option` (required for `<select>`), and treated a missing catalog entry as "rung absent." Detection is now probe-by-id (`cursor-ide-browser`); if that probe fails in an attended session, the agent asks once for `@Browser` (no space) or the Browser pane showing connected, then re-probes once (unattended runs skip the ask). The real flake is the whole MCP unregistering mid-run — that is not a first-use miss; `@Browser` does not restore it; stop with a partial pass (re-probe is a long shot). Console/network from the driven surface remain unverified, so a `/flow-next:qa` pass routed here must set `QA_OUTCOME=BLOCKED` with `blocked_reason` naming those missing channels (do not invent evidence paths). No install, no CLI/headless path. Details: [`cursor-ide-browser.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-drive/references/cursor-ide-browser.md), [`platforms.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/platforms.md).

## [flow-next 3.32.1] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **Model guidance refreshed for Grok 4.6 (released 2026-08-12).** The setup
  model-routing scaffold, `.flow/usage.md` bridge recipes, and orchestration
  docs move the grok tier to `grok-4.6` with an evidence-based reprofile:
  intelligence up (Artificial Analysis Index 61, tied with GPT-5.6 Sol Max;
  real-user consensus ~Opus 4.8-tier), raw speed down but ~2x turn efficiency,
  and a sharper routing rule - supervised editor-shaped implementation is its
  strong surface (CursorBench 69.9%, day-one Cursor integration with a
  permanent 2x usage pool), long unsupervised terminal loops are its weak one
  (Terminal-Bench v3 26%). The never-the-gate posture stands: AA-Omniscience
  measures it inventing ~1/3 of the time when it doesn't know, and API cache
  reads cost 67% more than 4.5 on long sessions. Cursor bridge slug verified
  live: `cursor-grok-4.6-high` (`-fast` at 2x price).

## [flow-next 3.32.0] - 2026-08-13

Reviewing a fresh plan used to mean reading a spec plus every task file — 500+
lines for a seven-task spec — and reconstructing the shape in your head just to
find out whether anything was wrong. Now you can ask for the shape directly, and
read only the file the shape says is wrong.

### Added

- **Review a plan, a task, a diff, or the conversation at a glance, on one
  screen.** `/flow-next:visual` (or plain language on description-matching hosts — "show me", "too much text",
  "walk me through the diff") restates the thing as a compact markdown digest:
  a thesis line, a task tree in dependency order, a planned file-layout diff
  with the owning task annotated, an R-ID coverage line where uncovered
  requirements jump out, and IS / IS-NOT boundaries. Every path and edge comes
  from real spec, task, or `git diff` state — the digest reports the shape, it
  never invents one, and it never writes, commits, or mutates flow state. It is
  the light register between raw markdown and the opt-in HTML render lenses,
  which stay exactly as they were. Mechanism: a fixed eight-shape vocabulary
  (pseudocode, call tree, component tree, shallow file tree, diff-fenced
  structural sketch, types and signatures, compact table, mermaid last) rendered
  in plain fenced blocks that colorize natively in the terminal, in chat, and on
  every forge — no rendering machinery, nothing to port. On Codex the digest is
  explicit-only (`$flow-next-visual`) — its trigger-rich description is kept out
  of the shared skill-catalog budget by design (see `docs/platforms.md`).
- **Capture, plan, and interview offer the digest at their read-back moment.**
  One line each, at the point where you have just been handed a wall of spec or
  tasks to check. An offer you pick, never an automatic run.
- **PR structural diagrams degrade to a sketch instead of collapsing.**
  `/flow-next:make-pr`'s `## Structural changes` may now emit a diff-fenced
  file-tree or call-tree sketch where mermaid is weakest — when the
  collapse-to-one rule would fire or a trigger fires marginally — carrying the
  same signal with no silent-rendering-failure risk. Same hallucination
  guardrails and prose-precedes-visual rule as mermaid; the `pr_cognitive_aid`
  schema, validator, and renderer are untouched.

## [flow-next 3.31.0] - 2026-08-12

On a free-plan private repo, branch protection and rulesets 403 - no required
status check can exist - so land's gate tree read a server that had nothing to
say, and a repo-local gate of record had no way to bind the merge. Fixes #330
- thanks @TechupBusiness for the precise gap analysis, including the correct
reading of `gate receipt` as an assertion warrant that must never be treated
as proof of execution.

### Added

- **`land.mergeVerdictCommand` - an opt-in, fail-closed repo merge-verdict
  gate (§2.9).** Once every other gate passes and the planned action is
  `merge`, land runs the configured command once (one blocking foreground
  call, 600s bound) with context in the environment only (`FLOW_HEAD_SHA`,
  `FLOW_BASE_REF`, `FLOW_PR_NUMBER`, `FLOW_SPEC_ID`). Exit 0 merges; any
  non-zero - including missing, unexecutable, timed out, or signal death -
  blocks with `NEEDS_HUMAN` and never skips. `--dry-run` reports `would-run`
  and executes nothing. The command runs on the base checkout, so it must key
  on `$FLOW_HEAD_SHA` and refuse when it cannot see that head. Unset, `null`,
  and `""` all mean off - today's behavior byte-for-byte. Where #313 kept
  gate-classification config closed, this key is accepted for the opposite
  reason the classifier ask was declined: it is block-only (a misconfiguration
  can only refuse merges, never permit one) and it guards an autonomous flow
  where conductor prose is not fail-closed.

### Docs

- **`gate classify`'s known fail-open is named (#334).** A CI-guarded
  generated doc (a code artifact wearing a `.md` name under `docs/`) classifies
  tier-B and the work loop skips the test/smoke gates on exactly the change the
  CI check exists to catch. The taxonomy stays closed to config per #313; the
  documented remedy is a conductor-instructions line naming the CI-guarded
  paths, and `docs/flowctl.md` now states the case and its blast radius (the
  local gate diet only - the repo's own CI still fires on the PR).

## [flow-next 3.30.0] - 2026-08-12

`review.backend codex` could return no verdict over and over - 13 consecutive
times in the report - while every probe said the backend was healthy, and the
terminal advice sent the operator to repair a CLI that was fine. The reviewer
subprocess was inheriting instructions never meant for it: the host repo's
auto-loaded `AGENTS.md` taught it to re-dispatch the review at itself (the
sandbox then rejected the nested dispatch), and the flow-next codex plugin's
own coordinator skills taught it to "never self-declare a verdict" - so it
reviewed well and withheld the verdict. Fixes #331 - thanks @sn-furali for
the isolating-controls table that separated the two routes.

### Fixed

- **Codex reviews get the persona override.** `needs_persona_override` was
  `False` for codex only because a registry refactor preserved pre-existing
  behavior - never a decision. The preamble (which already names auto-attached
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` and skill catalogs as superseded) now rides every
  codex review; the builder is renamed `build_review_persona_override` with a
  per-backend rationale. Costs nothing: codex delivery is stdin.
- **Host project docs are suppressed at the argv level.**
  `-c project_doc_max_bytes=0` on both the fresh and resume `codex exec`
  dispatch - the reporter's measured fix for the re-dispatch route.
- **The plan-review prompt states its role.** It was the only review prompt
  missing the "You ARE the reviewer - review directly" anchor the other three
  gained in #246 - which is why plan reviews blew up first. Ported, with the
  closing sentence reading "the plan", and both prompt hashes re-pinned.
- **No-verdict runs are classed honestly.** The failure ladder scanned the
  reviewer's own output for the word "timeout", so a healthy exit-0 review
  that mentioned timeouts was journaled as a transport timeout; the scan now
  reads stderr only (where every genuine `TimeoutExpired` lands). A streak of
  `missing_verdict` failures terminates with instruction-contamination
  guidance - the backend is probably healthy, do not repair it - instead of
  `repair the backend/environment`.

## [flow-next 3.29.0] - 2026-08-12

The worktree kit could not be driven from a script: `cleanup` - the only
sanctioned removal path - read two answers from stdin unconditionally and
died inside a bare `read` with no diagnostic when there was no terminal, and
`create` left the new branch tracking the base's remote branch, so under
`push.default=upstream` a bare `git push` aimed at the base. Fixes #333 -
thanks @sn-furali. (The issue's fourth ask - a `commands/` wrapper - is
answered in docs instead: the kit is already invocable by full skill name
on hosts that surface skills as commands.)

### Fixed

- **`cleanup [<name>...] [--yes]`.** Names as arguments skip the prompt;
  `--yes` skips the confirmation and is required off a terminal; both reads
  are EOF-guarded so a no-terminal run fails loudly naming the remedy
  instead of dying inside `read`. Interactive no-arg behavior unchanged.
- **`create` passes `--no-track`.** An isolated per-worktree branch no
  longer tracks the base's remote branch; first push needs
  `git push -u origin <name>`.
- **Invocation story told honestly.** README/skills.md no longer claim every
  skill answers to `/flow-next:<name>`: the five phrase-triggered skills
  answer to plain language and, on hosts that surface skills as commands,
  their full skill name (e.g. `/flow-next:flow-next-worktree-kit`).
  SKILL.md documents that `switch` prints the path (`cd "$(... switch x)"`).

## [flow-next 3.28.1] - 2026-08-12

A memory entry edited with `memory add --update` could come back different
from the one that went in, silently: the frontmatter re-serializer left a
mid-string `" #"` unquoted (any conforming YAML parser then reads the value
as truncated at the hash - flowctl's own fallback parser doesn't strip
comments, so the damage stays invisible until PyYAML or an editor reads the
file), and the no-PyYAML fallback split quoted flow-list items on every
comma, then wrote the mis-parse back as genuinely malformed YAML. Fixes #332
- thanks @sn-furali for the forensic report, including catching that flowctl
reads its own broken output back intact.

### Fixed

- **Mid-string `" #"` scalars are now quoted on write.** Whitespace-then-hash
  opens a YAML comment on read (YAML 1.2 §6.6/§7.3.3); the writer's quoting
  gate only checked a *leading* `#`. Non-comment hashes (`C#`, `issue#140`)
  stay unquoted. The shared gate means list items inherit the fix.
- **Flow-list splitting in the no-PyYAML fallback is quote- and depth-aware.**
  A 2-element list whose first element contains a comma now parses as 2
  verbatim elements instead of 3 mangled ones; a shared `_split_flow_items`
  helper replaces all three naive `split(",")` sites - recognizing quoted
  scalars at item starts, after mapping key separators, and at nested
  collection boundaries - and double-quoted mapping keys/values/items now
  unescape like the top-level branches (the latter two cases surfaced by
  Codex review on the PR).

## [flow-next 3.28.0] - 2026-08-11

A struck-out pilot spec on a board-armed repo could read ready everywhere a
human looks while staying permanently invisible to pilot - and the docs
described a recovery that has been impossible since fn-87. @sn-furali's
three-phase measurement (thanks!) proved both halves: a board echo re-grants
readiness with nobody acting, and a deliberate out-and-back move is
byte-identical to that echo in every durable artifact, so "an explicit
re-ready" was never something pilot could detect.

### Added

- **`flowctl pilot strikes list` / `clear <spec-id>` / `clear --all`.** The
  strikes ledger gets deterministic read and clear plumbing over its existing
  contract (`<git-common-dir>/flow-next/pilot-strikes.json`, shared across
  worktrees). `clear` is atomic, leaves other entries alone, and reports a
  distinct not-found for unknown ids; clearing a strike never changes spec
  readiness - strikes are pilot state, readiness is board/spec state. This is
  THE recognized human recovery under an armed `tracker.readyState`, and the
  `strike 2/2` verdict now names it, so the transcript carries its own way
  out. Recovery no longer means hand-editing an undocumented file under
  `.git/`. (#325)

### Fixed

- **The docs stop promising a recovery that cannot exist.** Since fn-87 a
  projection-set ready deliberately never clears a strike (clearing on a
  board echo would re-dispatch the same failing spec every tick forever), but
  tracker-sync.md and the site still said the opposite. Every surface now
  states the fn-87 rule, troubleshooting.md documents the ledger and the
  clear verb, and the board-native alternative is recorded as a deferred
  decision with its tick-granularity caveat. (#325, docs)

## [flow-next 3.27.0] - 2026-08-11

The tracker-bridge batch from the @sn-furali 2026-08-08 reports (thanks!): a
promotion race could leave two specs claiming one intake issue, a dedup query
against a populated board could look healthy while blind, a Linear issue could
not be placed in a Project, and abandoning a never-promoted candidate had no
documented shape.

### Fixed

- **The create-first mint claim is compare-and-set.** `sync create-first-put
  --if-absent` records the minted spec id only while the claim slot is free;
  the loser of a concurrent promotion exits `10` with `class=conflict`,
  `subtype=spec_already_minted`, and `details.recordedSpecId` naming the
  winner to adopt - instead of silently overwriting it. `--expect-spec-id`
  is the CAS update of a claim you already own; flagless `put` is unchanged.
  (#310)
- **Linear `wire list-open` refuses instead of lying.** With
  `tracker.readyState` unset it returned `{"issues": [], "success": true}` -
  indistinguishable from a genuinely empty board, so create-first dedup
  queries looked healthy while blind. It now returns an explicit
  `unresolved`/`ready_state` error naming the key and how to set it; leaving
  it unset remains a valid, deliberate configuration, and readyState-set
  behavior is unchanged. (#311)

### Added

- **Per-spec Linear Project membership.** Optional sidecar fields
  `tracker.projectId` / `tracker.projectMilestoneId` are sent on issue
  creation and reconciled on every sync-body push. Absent means unmanaged:
  today's payloads stay byte-identical and a Project set tracker-side is
  never cleared by flow-next, which carries exactly the id it is given and
  never creates or manages Projects. Verified live against the Linear
  sandbox, including the never-clears contract. (#315)
- **The abandon path for a never-promoted candidate is written down.** Close
  or cancel the remote issue first (that side is the consumer's, in the
  tracker's own tooling), then `sync create-first-clear` - ordering stated so
  a live intake issue is never left without a local trace. (#309, docs)

## [flow-next 3.26.0] - 2026-08-11

Two integrity gaps in what the pipeline tells you about your own work, both
from measured @sn-furali reports (thanks!). A fully-planned spec that had not
shipped code yet looked like 0% coverage and make-pr refused to open the draft
with advice you could not follow; and a rebase could orphan every evidence
commit a spec recorded while validate stayed green over the dead links.

### Fixed

- **make-pr opens draft PRs at the plan gate.** The coverage abort fired
  whenever no criterion was *evidenced*, which is every spec before work
  starts - the repro was a fully-planned, fully-declared spec refused with
  "run /flow-next:work" while make-pr itself blocked the way there. The abort
  now keys on *undeclared* coverage (no task's `satisfies` claims any
  criterion - the one state where the advice is actionable), and a plan-gate
  body renders honestly: the coverage table gains a third state (`claimed,
  not yet evidenced` beside evidenced and undeclared), the warning marker
  belongs only to genuinely unclaimed criteria, and the summary ratio stays
  evidenced-only with claimed/undeclared clauses appended when non-zero.
  (#301)

### Added

- **The export payload separates declared from evidenced coverage.**
  `tasks_summary.undeclared_r_ids` (R-IDs no task claims at any status) lands
  beside the unchanged `uncovered_r_ids` (R-IDs no done task satisfies), so
  consumers can ask the plan-gate and merge-gate questions separately;
  nothing reading the existing field changes. (#301)
- **`flowctl validate` notices orphaned evidence commits.** A rebase, amend,
  or squash-merge leaves recorded `evidence.commits[]` SHAs present in the
  object store but unreachable from HEAD; validate now reports each as a
  warning ("orphaned by a history rewrite; recorded value left as-is") while
  reachable commits stay silent and tokens that are not commits in this repo
  (tracker UUIDs, foreign SHAs) are ignored by design - flagging them would
  corrupt exactly the evidence the record exists to hold. Read-only: nothing
  is rewritten, the run never fails, and the whole pass costs two batched git
  reads regardless of commit count, so the land loop can keep calling
  validate freely. (#302)

## [flow-next 3.25.0] - 2026-08-10

Six small defects, one pass - every one arrived as a measured report with a
verified repro from @sn-furali (thanks!), and each fix takes the reporter's own
suggested design where one was offered. A criterion your spec wrote should
never vanish silently, a wrong platform guess should not survive on our primary
host, and a half-resolved tracker map should never read as resolved.

### Fixed

- **Suffixed R-IDs accepted by the PR cognitive aid.** `pr-cognitive-aid
  validate` now accepts the canonical sub-scoped sibling form (`R4a`) at both
  call sites via the one shared constant; `R4ab` and `R-4` stay rejected.
  (#300)
- **Acceptance-criteria shapes stop being dropped silently.** The export
  parser reads title-form (`**R14 - title**`) and parenthetical-form
  (`**R15 (note):**`) bullets and keeps wrapped continuation lines; the issue
  repro parses 5/5, and 25 criteria were recovered across this repo's own
  specs. Criterion-shaped bullets that still do not parse are now counted and
  surfaced as `acceptance_criteria_residue` in the export payload - a short
  coverage denominator is visible, never silent, and residue never aborts the
  export. (#303)
- **Setup counts SPEC.md files by inode, not by name.** On a case-insensitive
  filesystem a single `SPEC.md` no longer counts twice and prints a bogus
  both-files warning; case-sensitive dual-file repos still take the two-file
  branch. (#305)
- **Claude Code detects as Claude Code.** The setup platform cascade keyed its
  Claude branch on `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, which never reaches a plugin skill's
  Bash env - so our primary host fell through to the codex fallback and got
  `$flow-next-` snippets. The branch now keys on `CLAUDECODE` paired with the
  Claude plugin manifest as a positive discriminator, and sits below
  Droid/Cursor/Grok so those hosts' own signals outrank the child-inherited
  marker. (#306)
- **`tracker resolve --select` finishes the job.** Picking one ambiguous slot
  now runs the normal assignment over the remaining slots and persists the
  union; a map still missing a required slot is kept but reported as CONFLICT
  and left unstamped, so a later plain `resolve` repairs it instead of
  skipping a fresh-looking scope. `in_review` still never auto-fills. Configs
  already half-stamped by this bug self-repair on the next `--select`. (#308)

### Added

- **`flowctl start --reclaim` - identity repair, distinct from takeover.**
  Rewrites the claimant of a task held by a stale or wrong identity and
  records `Reclaimed from <identity> (identity repair)`, so `--force` keeps
  its takeover meaning and the record says which one happened. Only the
  claim-ownership gates relax; dependency/blocked/done still require
  `--force`. (#316)
- **Gate-classify extensibility documented as deliberately closed.** The path
  taxonomy takes no config key by design; per-repo gate policy belongs in the
  consumer's conductor instructions with `pilot.gateClasses` as the open
  vocabulary, and classifier reason strings are not a stable contract.
  (#313, docs)

## [flow-next 3.24.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Judgment agents no longer fall to a fast tier on portable hosts.** The
  agent files' `model:` fields are Claude family aliases; on a host that does
  not resolve them (Cursor, Droid, Grok Build) the plan skill now states that
  judgment-tier dispatches - the gap analyst and the sonnet-tier scouts - run
  on the session model, never the host's fast default. A field run saw
  `flow-gap-analyst` (requirement analysis) served by a fast tier; scanner
  scouts may still ride the fast default.
- **Model pins are probed ids only.** Cursor/Copilot model ids vary per
  account and surface (the same install may serve `composer-2.5` or
  `composer-2.5-fast`, never both); the setup model-pin ceremony now hard-
  requires any cursor/copilot pin to appear verbatim in that CLI's probe
  output this run (codex pins in `CODEX_ACCEPTED`), and proposes no new pin
  when the probe failed. The routing scaffold's cursor bridge line carries the
  same verify-before-invoking warning. A field run self-healed after invoking
  a slug remembered from docs.

## [flow-next 3.24.0] - 2026-08-10

A review verdict you cannot audit is a verdict you have to take on faith. A
resumed reviewer session can answer from its previous round's context in ~1 KB
with zero tool calls while asserting "measured" facts - and the verdict text
looks identical to a real one. Attempt rows now record how the verdict was
produced, so a consumer (or a human) can ask "was this measured?" instead of
trusting narration. Fixes #312 - thanks @sn-furali for the measured report.

### Added

- **Review-attempt rows carry work volume and provenance.** Every new
  `review_attempts[]` row records `output_bytes` (size only - the output is
  never retained); `tool_calls` where the backend's event stream let the
  dispatcher genuinely count them (codex `exec --json`) - a measured `0` is
  recorded, the fabrication signal itself, while plain-text paths carry no
  key; `head_sha_observed` marking whether `head_sha` came from the
  pre-dispatch snapshot or the finalize-time fallback (the `review-rounds
  record` CLI path always takes the fallback); and `base_sha` beside
  `head_sha` wherever the review snapshot ran, so the judged diff can be
  located and re-rendered. `review-rounds attempts --json` surfaces all of
  it; rows written by older versions read back with the fields absent -
  absence means unknown, never zero. The measurement is gated to the codex
  backend (a copilot/cursor review quoting codex-shaped event lines never gets
  a fabricated count), and crash replay preserves the journaled provenance
  instead of degrading to the finalize-time fallback. (#312)

## [flow-next 3.23.0] - 2026-08-09

A wrong answer you can recognize costs a glance; a wrong answer dressed as a
right one costs review rounds. Status reads now say where their answer came
from, reviewers stop judging task lifecycle from files that were never the
authority, and the pre-work commands warn when the checkout itself is behind.
Fixes #304 and #307 — thanks @sn-furali for the measured reports.

### Added

- **Status output carries its provenance.** `flowctl show` and `list` task
  entries under `--json` now include `status_source` — `"flow-state"` when the
  authoritative runtime store answered, `"committed"` when the answer came from
  a tracked snapshot that may be stale — and plain output prints one advisory
  line when the runtime state directory is absent. A fresh clone or diff-scoped
  sandbox can no longer present a stale snapshot as a confident answer. (#304)
- **The pre-work commands notice a stale checkout.** `ready` (including
  `--all`) and `anchor` warn once per invocation when HEAD is behind its
  upstream (`stale_vs_upstream` under `--json`), because a wrong answer just
  before starting work is the most expensive one. One read-only git probe,
  never a fetch, never blocking — and deliberately NOT added to `list`,
  `status`, or `next`, whose fast-poll performance stays untouched. (#307)

### Changed

- **Reviewers no longer judge task bookkeeping.** Both shared review prompts
  (plan review, completion review) now state that committed task-file `status`
  fields are snapshots — live lifecycle state lives outside a diff-scoped
  review context — and that a task looking not-started in committed files is
  never grounds for a finding. Closes the measured failure where a compliant
  spec ate three review rounds over sidecar staleness. (#304)

## [flow-next 3.22.0] - 2026-08-09

When one agent hands work to the next — a worker returning to its conductor, a
chart handing a briefing to capture, a finished run handing you the follow-up —
the handover now carries pointers and the next runnable command instead of a
second copy of the content. Restated content is written twice, drifts the moment
the artifact moves, and is re-read at full length by every consumer; a pointer
is stable, and the consumer reads the current truth.

### Changed

- **Worker returns point at the outcome instead of retelling it.** A finished
  worker reports the task id, terminal status, the summary and evidence file
  paths, the commit range, and — where its path allows — the review verdict; it
  no longer restates what was implemented, which files changed, or which tests
  ran, because the files it just wrote already say so and the conductor reads
  them directly. Parallel-wave workers additionally name their assigned
  workspace and gate results for the join. A return that restates summary
  content the files already carry now reads as a contract break.
- **Every finished run ends with a runnable next step.** The work skill's final
  summary gains an executable `Next:` line (open the PR, or run QA first when
  the pipeline asks for it), and the chart-to-capture handoff is now a
  paste-ready command carrying the briefing path — the reader runs the handoff
  rather than reconstructing it.
- **The handover doctrine is written down where teams read it.** The teams page
  gains a fifth handover property — pointer-shaped, not restated — with its two
  deliberate carve-outs: consumers without repo access get content because
  content is the transport there, and bounded control signals (a verdict enum,
  an id, a strike class inlined so a transcript-only driver need not re-read a
  file) count as pointers, not content.

### Under the hood

- The worker-return shape and the `Next:` line are pinned by prose-contract
  tests alongside the existing final-summary pins, and the conduct checklist
  for the work skill states both as checkable failure signatures. The Codex
  mirror rewrites the `Next:` line to its executable skill form. The one
  cross-copy sentence shared by the canonical prose and the mirror generator's
  section template is content-pinned so the copies must move together.

## [flow-next 3.21.0] - 2026-08-09

A single code reviewer covering everything has a failure mode this release
removes: attention gets captured by whichever problem class surfaces first, and
a hygiene pass that turns up plenty of nits can leave a behavioral defect
unremarked. The in-host quality audit now runs as two parallel reviewers with
disjoint charters — one judging whether the change does what the spec pins, one
judging code shape and standards — so neither territory can spend the other's
attention, and neither report can bury the other's findings.

### Changed

- **The Phase 4 quality audit is two axis-scoped reviews, not one generalist
  pass.** When the work skill judges a change large or risky, it dispatches the
  quality-auditor agent twice in a single message — `AXIS: correctness` and
  `AXIS: standards` — and the two reports are presented verbatim under two
  headings, never merged, reranked, or interleaved. The correctness axis owns
  spec conformance, interpretation gaps, silent regressions of earlier work,
  assertion weakening in existing tests, security, and test coverage; the
  standards axis owns simplicity, duplication, dead code, over-engineering,
  naming, vocabulary drift, and performance shape, and carries its review
  rubric inline so it needs no repo docs at dispatch time.
- **Hygiene cannot inflate the fix loop.** The standards axis's highest tier is
  Should Fix — it structurally cannot emit a Critical finding or a Ship
  verdict; if it believes it found an outage-grade issue it hands the
  observation across as an untiered line for the conductor to route (at most
  two). Each axis also carries a hard finding cap (eight tiered on
  correctness, five on standards, at most three Considers each) with overflow
  declared in the suppressed-findings line rather than dropped silently. Only
  correctness-axis Criticals block; Considers never do.
- **A dispatch without an axis fails toward the higher-value axis, visibly.**
  A prompt with no `AXIS:` line runs the correctness charter and opens its
  report with an explicit `Axis defaulted:` notice — never a silent
  both-axes pass, which would recreate the single-reviewer failure.

### Under the hood

- The two-axis contract is pinned by `test_two_axis_audit_contract.py`
  (axis selection, standards severity ceiling, per-axis caps, one-message
  dispatch, verbatim aggregation — canonical and Codex mirror), and by conduct
  checklists for the auditor and the work skill in `agent_docs/conduct/`.
  Any reviewer-behavior change is additionally gated on replaying a banked
  reviewer-regression corpus: two historical review catches (an
  interpretation-gap miss and an assertion-weakening regression) must survive
  the new reviewer before it ships; both did.
- The shared audit machinery — fail-closed diff resolution, discrete
  confidence anchors, the suppression gate, and the protected-artifacts
  filter — is unchanged and now single-owner above both charters. The
  standards axis's inline smell baseline is a superset of the review fleet's
  pinned baseline.

## [flow-next 3.20.0] - 2026-08-09

Declined scope stays declined, unknowns stop masquerading as content, and the
prose that steers agents now states its rules as checkable failure signatures
instead of shouting. This release is the style-and-structure half of the
disclosure work in 3.19.0: leaner spec artifacts (paid back on every anchor,
review, and plan-sync read), and skill prose whose force comes from being
falsifiable rather than capitalized.

### Added

- **A declined-scope ledger.** The first time a feature is refused on policy
  grounds, the refusal gets a file in `.flow/memory/declined/` — decision,
  reasoning, and a dated `## Prior requests` list that accumulates recurrence
  evidence. Plan checks it before proposing scope and only the user reopens a
  declined concept; "declined because it already exists" never gets a file
  (the ledger records judgment, not history). Kills the re-litigated scope
  debate at the source.
- **A `## Parked unknowns` spec section.** Genuinely-unknown items pass the
  fog-or-ticket test (decidable now → decide; schedulable → task; unknown →
  park) and graduate into real sections when interview or plan resolves them.
  Unknowns stop being written up as half-specified content.
- **Spec durability rule.** Specs state contracts — types, signatures,
  behaviors — never file paths or line numbers, which rot on the first
  refactor and turn plan-sync into churn. One carved exception for
  decision-rich snippets whose location is the decision. Tasks are exempt by
  design: `**Files:**`/`**Touches:**` remain a task's job.
- **`Done when:` bounds on procedure steps.** ~60 new completion bounds
  across qa, map, setup, drive, work, pilot, land, prospect, plan, and the
  small skills — each carrying demand ("every X accounted for"), not just
  clarity. The corpus now holds 133 Done-when blocks.
- **An experimental skill tier.** Experimental skills ship in the plugin but
  stay out of the tables and counts; retirement is deletion. Shipping an
  experiment costs a folder, not a support commitment.

### Changed

- **Failure-signature declaratives replace ALL-CAPS shouting.** Hundreds of
  CRITICAL/MUST/FORBIDDEN blocks across the skill corpus rewritten as bolded
  declaratives with checkable failure signatures ("A SHIP with no backend
  response behind it has broken this"), meaning-preserving line by line. What
  survives in caps is load-bearing by proof: test-pinned literals, executed
  fences, mirror-transform anchors, and eval-guarded blocks each kept with a
  named reason.
- **The repo glossary is now a vocabulary dictionary.** 41k characters of
  encyclopedia became ~100 lines: 12 load-bearing terms, one definition and
  an `Avoid:` synonym ban each (spec, not epic/ticket/story; plan-sync, not
  tracker-sync). Full text archived at `agent_docs/archive/GLOSSARY-full.md`.
  The glossary product feature is untouched.
- **Guide carries a router-staleness rule** — a router that recommends a
  removed skill or misses an existing one is a defect, and skill
  additions/removals must update guide in the same change. The rule caught
  its first gap on arrival: guide now routes "no written direction" to
  `/flow-next:strategy`.
- **Install instructions are single-sourced** from the root README with
  instance pointers, and judgment-boundary prose in plan, chart, and guide
  names the pull-to-just-do-the-work as the signal you're at a boundary.

### Fixed

- The Codex mirror's plan rewrite had been a silent no-op since the
  depth-tier rework — its sed anchors targeted prose that no longer existed.
  Anchors revived; Codex hosts again get multi-agent phrasing instead of the
  Claude-specific Task-tool wording.
- memory-migrate's report skeleton had drifted from its canonical copy
  (two sections missing); the duplicate is now a pointer to the one source.
- Two orphaned `flowctl-reference.md` files (unlinked from any skill or
  test) deleted from impl-review and spec-completion-review.

### Under the hood

Every conversion was grepped against the test corpus and the mirror-transform
script before editing; test pins were retargeted in the same commits, never
weakened. Prose-contract tests, conduct checklists, and the full suite gated
each wave.

## [flow-next 3.19.0] - 2026-08-09

Every skill invocation now loads a lean universal spine and reads the rest
only when its path actually needs it. That makes sessions cheaper - and, more
importantly, an agent mid-branch no longer wades through instructions for
branches it is not on, which is where instruction-following quietly erodes in
long, condition-heavy prose.

flow-next committed to progressive disclosure from its very first commit -
slim command prose, scout subagents returning digests instead of raw context -
and shipped stub commands before harnesses merged commands with skills or
learned to load skill bodies on demand. Since then, dozens of releases of
features our users needed grew the big skills many-branched, and we were
derelict in our duty to keep the disclosure discipline current with that
growth. This release fixes that, and adds the harness that keeps it fixed:
every skill now has a **conduct checklist** (`agent_docs/conduct/` - four to
six falsifiable observables per skill) that prose changes are reviewed and
dogfooded against, so the discipline can no longer rot silently.

### Changed

- **Ten skills refactored to branch-disclosure shape.** What every invocation
  needs stays inline; what only some paths reach moved verbatim into
  `references/*.md` read at the branch point, behind fail-open probe gates
  where a config decides the branch. Always-loaded prose drops up to 63%
  where modes are truly exclusive (chart), 15-40% across the heavy skills
  (capture -37%, impl-review -25% to -34% per backend path, work -18.5%,
  audit -15.6%), smaller but real cuts on plan, interview, qa, prospect,
  make-pr, and spec-completion-review. Every safety net, every-run contract,
  and calibration block stays inline - the refactor moved prose, it did not
  reword it, and each skill was verified against its conduct checklist.
- **Prose-contract tests now pin content and reachability, not file
  location.** A verbatim move to a reachable reference no longer breaks the
  suite; what breaks it is content disappearing or becoming unreachable. The
  rule new tests follow is documented in `agent_docs/adding-skills.md`, and a
  new encoding guard keeps every reference file (and its Codex mirror twin)
  clean UTF-8.

### Removed

- **The rp-explorer skill and the context-scout planning agent.** Nothing
  dispatched rp-explorer, and planning always used repo-scout in practice -
  removing context-scout also removes an entire research-mode question branch
  from plan. RepoPrompt remains fully supported as a review backend
  everywhere it was before.

### Fixed

- interview's doc-aware autodetect probe was fail-closed (a probe failure
  silently disabled doc-aware behavior); rewritten to the canonical fail-open
  gate skeleton.
- make-pr's inline mermaid recap had drifted to 8 rules while the canonical
  checklist carries 9 (the subgraph/node-id collision rule, validated on a
  real PR, was missing from the recap); the duplicate recap is gone.
- sync-codex now applies the actionable impl-review invocation rewrite to
  work's reference files, not just phases.md - Codex hosts no longer receive
  the Claude-only slash form on the wave-join and host-deferred paths.
- Stale cross-links in impl-review's backend files (optional-phase dispatch
  pointed at content's old home).

### Running lean is now a documented choice, not a guess

flow-next has always run fully as spec -> plan -> work, with everything else
optional - but the docs never said so evenly, and never said what any of it
costs. Tracker sync opened straight into projection theory with "off until
explicitly enabled" buried three sections down; nothing anywhere told you what
turning a layer on would actually cost you. So the honest answer to "do I need
all of this?" was only available to people who already knew.

New page [`docs/running-lean.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/running-lean.md)
answers it directly. It frames two **operating profiles** - **human-driven**,
where you are present and can be the reviewer, the tracker, and the QA, so you
run lean and reach for layers deliberately; and **autonomous**, where nobody is
watching, so those same layers are what replace you and the run should be
gated. Neither is the real mode. The failure it exists to prevent is paying
autonomous-profile costs while sitting at the keyboard: a full tracker
round-trip on every lifecycle event for a spec only you will ever read.

Every optional layer is then priced with the same four fields: what it
automates away from you, what it costs **structurally** (a bidirectional
round-trip per lifecycle event, an extra review pass per round - never a
benchmark number), when it earns its keep, and the manual invocation if you
want the capability without the standing cost. Each layer's stated default was
read from the published config schema rather than assumed, so the two layers
that are **on** by default (plan-sync, memory) say so, with the genuinely
optional part named precisely - for memory that is the audit sweep, not the
tree.

The optionality caveat itself is now one canonical pattern with a
change-here-first note, instanced at the top of each optional subsystem's page
and into the published config-schema descriptions, so the posture is visible
wherever you meet the toggle instead of only where you meet the narrative.

A lean run still leaves a record: stage receipts already carry
`skipped(reason)`, so a layer you deliberately left off is an explicit entry
with your reason attached rather than a silent absence. Read it back with
`flowctl usage --stages <spec-id>`.

### Deprecated: Ralph, and packaged codex delegation

Both predate the orchestration primitives that now replace them. **Nothing is
removed, no defaults change, and existing installs keep working** - these are
signals so the field stops adopting a path we intend to retire, and both
reference pages stay maintained for current users.

- **Ralph** (`/flow-next:ralph-init`, `scripts/ralph/`). A shell script calling
  `/flow-next:pilot` to build and `/flow-next:land` to ship, driven by a host
  loop or `cron`, does the same job without the scaffold, the guard-hook
  registration, or the second receipt plumbing. New setups should use pilot +
  land.
- **Packaged codex delegation** (`work.delegate*`, `delegate:codex`). Superseded
  by the agentic route: the `/flow-next:setup` model-routing scaffold writes
  standing routing prose into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` that is loaded every
  turn - including unattended runs - and `.flow/usage.md` carries the bridge
  recipes. That covers what the packaged subsystem was built for without a
  second config surface duplicating the role map. Removal is specced separately
  as `flow-98`.

Documentation only: no behavior, config, or default changes from these two
sections. Removal of packaged codex delegation stays specced separately as
`flow-98`.

## [flow-next 3.18.0] - 2026-08-08

The flow-efficiency release: five disciplines measured in a replay campaign
against real shipped work, landed as one batch. Autonomous planning now
resists its own worst habit - building more than you asked for: two unguided
replay runs of the same real request each invented a 500-900-line
risk-management subsystem the request never needed, while a run carrying the
new scope-minimality prose declined that machinery explicitly and delivered
43% fewer output tokens at 57% lower cost, with reviewed quality above the
unguided arm. Around that core, tasks became lean delegation payloads,
planning artifacts became editable files, pipeline stages stopped being able
to fail silently, and worker concurrency got an explicit fail-closed rule.

### Changed

- Plans are now bound to scope minimality: every task must trace to a
  requirement, every requirement to the request, and capabilities nobody asked
  for become one-line Boundaries exclusions instead of tasks. Planners are
  steered to eliminate risks structurally (a closed schema, an inert format,
  an unexposed capability) before building machinery to manage them.
- Plan review treats overengineering as a finding, not a taste note - on both
  review rubric copies. Reviewers flag untraceable surface, risk-management
  machinery where structural elimination was available, and N-way generality
  for a one-case request.
- Workers build to the acceptance criteria, not past them; mid-implementation
  ideas land in the done summary as follow-ups, never as unrequested code.
- The discipline trims scope, never rigor: error-case enumeration and
  filesystem-identity, permission, and concurrency guards (symlink
  containment, lock-guarded writes, runtime-state excludes) are explicitly
  exempt - an eliminated guard is not an eliminated feature.
- Planning documents are now authored as files and revised with span edits
  instead of re-emitted bash heredocs - a plan that goes through review fix
  loops is edited in place rather than regenerated wholesale (measured 13%
  cheaper in both replay A/B pairs; short transient payloads of about ten
  lines may still use heredocs).
- Spec examples are now the contract: when a spec shows an output, event, or
  API shape, the fields shown are exhaustive - implementations may not add
  fields the example does not show. This closes a deviation class caught
  twice in benchmark and field runs (an implementer "helpfully" extending a
  shown shape past the spec).
- Same-spec worker waves now dispatch by an explicit fail-closed rule instead
  of a judgment call: tasks run concurrently only when their declared
  Touches: sets are disjoint, no dependency path connects them (transitively),
  the wave is at most three tasks, and nothing touches the always-serial set
  (.flow/, lockfiles, migrations, generated outputs). Anything missing or
  doubtful stays serial - exactly today's behavior. A join conflict is never
  auto-resolved: the losing task re-runs serially and the collision is
  recorded in the receipt, so wrong declarations surface to plan review.
  Review of a finished task may overlap the next dep-independent task's
  implementation, with plan-sync still the barrier before dependent work.
  Verified by a sequential-equivalence replay (wave and serial runs produce
  identical test outcomes).
- Pipeline stages now leave an explicit outcome - ran, skipped with a reason,
  or failed with a reason - in the receipts they already write, so a silently
  no-oping stage (the class behind issue #293, where plan-sync no-oped for
  weeks) is visible on its first occurrence: a skipped stage is an event with
  a reason, never an absence, and a stage with no line is treated by review
  as failed. `flowctl usage --stages <spec>` summarizes the lines per spec
  (plain and JSON); malformed lines are counted, never a crash. No new state
  stores; token telemetry stays out of scope (host-side data the CLI cannot
  observe).
- Tasks are now the delegation payload: named files, concrete approach, and
  task-scoped acceptance that let a cheaper implementer build without
  re-deriving design decisions. Tasks reference the spec's R-IDs instead of
  restating its context - replay agents wrote tasks at roughly three times
  the fleet norm, and the bloat was paraphrased spec context that drifts.
  Nothing is lost: executors always receive the task together with the full
  parent spec. Tasks can also declare a Touches: line (the paths they expect
  to modify) for later concurrency planning; leaving it out is safe and
  simply means serial scheduling.
- Workers run focused tests for the code under change while iterating; the
  full suite runs only where an existing gate's Quick commands already
  require it, never as a mid-loop reflex - in the replay campaign 54% of
  full-suite runs were redundant mid-loop re-runs at roughly three times the
  targeted-test cost. No gate definition changes. Test mass follows the
  spec's error enumeration: one focused test per acceptance criterion and
  error case, table-driven over copy-paste, no re-testing already-covered
  branches.

## [flow-next 3.17.0] - 2026-08-08

Two field reports from the same practitioner, one shape of problem: state that
could not be corrected, and silent no-ops where an error belonged. Charts can
now record that discovery disproved one of their own starting facts, in the
same transaction that closes the decision. `flowctl setup-block` can manage
several marker blocks in one file and answer "has this block been hand-edited?"
without writing anything, which makes it usable as a CI gate. Thanks to
@sn-furali for both reports (#292, #294).

### Added

- **A resolve can correct a grounding note in the same transaction that closes
  the decision.** `resolve --sharpen-file` accepts a new `notes_append` key: a
  dated correction bullet gets appended to `## Notes` (the section is created
  if the chart has none), existing notes are never rewritten, and the next
  `chart briefing` renders the correction alongside the original fact. The
  resolve result reports what was appended under `notes_appended`, always a
  list. An identical retry does not double-append - it folds into the
  existing `decision_immutable` error instead. Corrections after a chart's
  final briefing ride the existing `chart reopen` re-mint path on a follow-up
  decision; a resolved decision stays immutable.
- **Several managed blocks can live in one file, each tracked independently.**
  `--id <BLOCK-ID>` on `apply`, `resolve`, and the new `check` derives that
  id's own marker pair and its own recorded state. Omit `--id` (or pass
  `--id FLOW-NEXT`) for the original single-block behavior - markers,
  transitions, exit codes, and every existing caller are unchanged. A custom
  id never touches another id's block, even a stray or corrupt one, in the
  same file.
- **`flowctl setup-block check` answers "did someone hand-edit this?" without
  writing.** It classifies a managed block read-only - pristine, drifted, or
  structurally broken - and exits non-zero on anything but a clean match, so
  CI (especially a `setup_mode: copy` repo, where the block is an ordinary
  tracked file) can gate on a hand-edit with no risk of a write. A block that
  was edited and reverted reads clean, and a CRLF-only difference is never
  drift. `docs/flowctl.md` carries the exit-code table and a copy-paste CI
  recipe.

### Changed

- **A typo in `--sharpen-file` is now an error instead of a silent no-op.**
  Any key outside `decisions`, `remove_questions` (and its `remove_parked` /
  `parked_removals` aliases), and the new `notes_append` fails the whole
  resolve with `sharpen_file_unknown_key`, naming the offending key(s) and the
  accepted set, checked before anything is allocated or persisted. An explicit
  `null` value is rejected the same way rather than read as an omitted key.
- **A setup-block template must now be exactly its marker-pair block:** the
  BEGIN marker on the first line, the END marker on the last, a trailing
  newline, and no marker token embedded in the body. Prose outside the pair
  used to be written and hashed by `apply` but never seen by the span-based
  comparison, so a freshly applied block could report as customized; a
  template without its trailing newline ate the END marker's line terminator
  on refresh and welded an adjacent block's BEGIN onto it. Every template
  flow-next ships already conforms - a custom template with surrounding prose
  now fails with a clear error instead of drifting silently.

### Fixed

- **A final chart briefing's header now shows the chart's actual status.**
  `chart briefing` used to render the chart's status from just before the
  open-to-done transition it was itself completing, so a final briefing could
  say `open` in its own header while `chart show` immediately afterward said
  `done`. The header now reflects the post-transition status.
- **Tracking a second block in a file no longer clobbers the first block's
  recorded state.** Pristine-hash state is keyed per (file, block id) rather
  than per file; a pre-existing recorded hash is read transparently as the
  default block's state and upgraded on the next write, with no separate
  migration step.
- **`setup-block` fails closed on a structurally broken block in the places it
  previously let through.** `resolve --choice keep` recorded the customized
  sentinel without ever validating the operated span; a duplicate or orphaned
  marker for the operated id after the first valid pair escaped the corruption
  scan entirely; and `check` released its lock between reading state and
  reading the target, so a concurrent `apply` could skew the verdict. All
  three now hold the documented per-id fail-closed contract, and `check` still
  writes nothing in any branch.
- **A correction bullet that starts with a hyphen keeps it.** `notes_append`
  only strips a real `- ` markdown bullet marker, so prose like `--legacy` or
  `-5 ms` is recorded verbatim, and the existing note region stays
  byte-identical when a correction is appended.

## [flow-next 3.16.3] - 2026-08-07

Hardens the spec-split path shipped hours ago in 3.16.2, after a live
end-to-end run of the whole capture workflow surfaced prose defects the
section-level testing could not see.

### Fixed

- **Choosing the split can no longer be read as "abort".** Three leftover
  references to the pre-3.16.2 `consider-split` option said splitting exits
  without writing; an agent following those lines instead of the new option
  would have produced zero specs. All copies now agree: `split-as-proposed`
  writes the linked set.
- **You see the actual spec documents before they are written.** The split
  path now prints every composed spec body and asks one confirmation before
  creating anything - previously you ratified an allocation table and the
  N documents were authored after approval, unseen.
- **Captured specs keep their title.** The write step replaces the whole
  spec file, and the old instruction forbade the body from carrying a title
  heading - shipping heading-less specs. Bodies now open with their own
  heading.
- Split-composition rules made explicit: cross-cutting requirements are
  duplicated into every spec they constrain; user-stated process items
  ("tests must pass") are honored in prose, never as counted criteria; a
  clause matching several business-signal categories counts once.

## [flow-next 3.16.2] - 2026-08-07

POs, PMs, and devs who capture an epic, a briefing package, or a large
feature no longer have to guess whether it should be one spec or several -
capture now tells you, with the actual split in hand.

### Added

- **Capture proposes how many specs your input should be.** When a capture
  drafts 8 or more real requirements - business and technical only; standing
  criteria and process items like "tests must be green" are never counted -
  or the requirements clearly serve more than one independently shippable
  outcome, the read-back includes a concrete proposal: per-spec titles, which
  requirements go to which spec, and the dependency edges between them. One
  answer (`split-as-proposed`) writes all of them, linked. The judgment is
  independence, not size: a large-but-cohesive spec is recommended to stay
  one spec, and small captures see nothing new. Nothing ever splits without
  your say-so; autonomous runs record the proposal inside the spec instead
  of acting on it.
- **Interview makes the same call when a spec outgrows itself.** When
  refinement pushes a spec past the threshold or an answer reveals a second
  independent outcome, interview proposes the split before writing back,
  with a guard that never renumbers criteria a review has already judged.

## [flow-next 3.16.1] - 2026-08-07

If you opted into plan-sync, it now actually runs. Since the step shipped, the
work loop's downstream-task extraction misread the task list's JSON shape, the
error went to stderr, and the empty result looked exactly like "no downstream
tasks to update" - so completed work never propagated drift into the tasks that
came after it, and nothing said so. Thanks @sn-furali for the report and the
measured diagnosis (#293).

### Fixed

- **Plan-sync reaches downstream tasks instead of silently skipping them.** The
  work skill's downstream-ID extraction read `flowctl tasks --json` as a bare
  array; it is an `{success, tasks, count}` envelope, so the jq filter errored
  and the section's "skip if empty" contract swallowed the failure. The filter
  now reads `.tasks[]`, and a failed extraction sets an explicit
  `EXTRACT_FAILED` sentinel so a shape mismatch can never masquerade as the
  legitimate nothing-to-do case again. (#293)
- **Spec-completion-review (RepoPrompt classic mode) selects task files again.**
  The same bare-array read sat in its tab-selection loop; task markdown files
  were silently never added to the review selection.

## [flow-next 3.16.0] - 2026-08-07

Cross-model review now sees the whole change, and stops being cut off while it is
working.

Reviewers used to be handed a copy of the diff inside the prompt — capped at 50 KB,
so on a large change they received about a tenth of the evidence their verdict
rested on, then read the rest off disk anyway. That copy is gone. A review now
receives the commit range, the exact list of changed files, and the paths to the
spec and tasks, and the reviewer fetches what it needs at the depth each part
warrants. Nothing is shortened to fit, nothing is summarised on your behalf, and
the file list is complete — no elided paths, no `{old => new}` rename shorthand, no
mangled non-ASCII filenames. On a re-review the reviewer continues its own session
instead of being re-briefed, so it compares against findings it actually remembers
making; if a session cannot be resumed, the findings travel in the prompt as before
rather than a blind review being dispatched.

One expectation to set honestly: this makes reviews *better informed*, not
provably cheaper. The prompt itself shrank by 83% on this release's own largest
review, but a fetching reviewer spends turns on tool calls instead, and total
input tokens for those rounds came out above the pre-change measurements — mostly
cached, so billable cost does not track the raw number, but not a demonstrated
saving either. A fetching reviewer is also slower in wall-clock on a big diff, and
hit the fixed 600-second backend timeout on 3 of 10 review
dispatches; every one was recorded as a transport failure with the review round
refunded, exactly as intended. The measurements are
in `optimization/reached-path/evidence/fn169/`.

Review loops that were converging no longer get cut off and handed to a human to
verify by hand. Three specs in a row hit that in the field — each one escalated at
round 2 of 8 with a shrinking finding set — because the loop was guessing at
convergence from finding counts and severity trends instead of reading what the
reviewer actually said. It now reads resolutions: the re-review prompt states the
exact format for reporting prior findings, the parser accepts every token that
prompt advertises, and the guessing rules are gone. A reviewer that follows the
format gets its resolutions recorded and the loop ends when it should; one that
ignores it simply runs out of rounds instead of being misjudged. Because rounds
are now the only bound in that case, the cap is a project setting rather than an
environment variable, so the cost ceiling is yours to set — and, under an
autonomous loop, only yours to raise.

### Fixed

- **Review loops stop escalating while they are converging.** Three specs in a
  row hit `ESCALATE: review loop stalled` at round 2 of 8 with a visibly
  shrinking finding set, and each time a human had to hand-verify the loop and
  record a basis in evidence before it could ship. The cause was a prompt that
  asked reviewers to report which prior findings were fixed without ever stating
  the format the parser reads: the reviewer answered in prose, nothing parsed,
  every prior finding carried forward as still-open, and a trend rule concluded
  the loop was flat. The re-review prompt now states the exact line grammar with
  an example (`Prior finding #2: not-fixed`, or one `Prior findings: all fixed`
  line when everything is resolved), and the same wording reaches host-backend
  reviewers. A reviewer that follows it gets its resolutions recorded; a reviewer
  that ignores it simply runs out of rounds instead of being misjudged. (fn-168)
- **The prompt had been advertising a status the parser rejected.** It asked for
  "fixed or **not-fixed**", but the hyphenated spelling failed the canonical
  matcher while matching the loose one — so a reviewer that complied *exactly*
  had its entire round of structured findings silently discarded. The hyphen is
  accepted now, and a test extracts every status token and example line from the
  live prompt and proves each one parses, so the two cannot drift apart again.
  (fn-168)
- **A finding the reviewer called unfixed once no longer escalates a later round
  that says nothing about it.** Statuses were carried forward verbatim, so a
  single "not-fixed" persisted through silent rounds and read as a repeat. The
  loop now only ends early when the reviewer explicitly calls the *same* finding
  unfixed in two consecutive rounds. (fn-168)

### Changed

- **Reviewers see the whole change instead of the first 50 KB of it.** The diff
  body, the spec text, and the task specs are no longer copied into the review
  prompt. A review is dispatched with the `base..head` range, `git diff --numstat
  --no-renames` as the exact scope map, and repo-relative spec/task paths; the
  reviewer runs in your checkout and reads what it needs. Measured on this repo's
  own history: the embedded body was 641,784 bytes against a 50 KB cap, so
  reviewers were shown ~10% of it and fetched the rest regardless. The file list
  matters as much as the deletion, and git abbreviates in three separate ways that
  all had to be turned off: `--stat` elided 51 of 65 paths on that same change,
  plain `--numstat` collapses renames into `{old => new}` so neither real path
  appears, and without `-z` any non-ASCII path comes back C-quoted. A scope map you
  cannot resolve to paths cannot bound a review. What changes for the reviewer is
  completeness, not kind — it reads the same code, from disk, in full. What changes
  for you is wall-clock: a fetching reviewer spends turns on tool calls, so a large
  diff takes longer and can reach the backend's fixed timeout, which is recorded as
  a transport failure and refunds the round. (fn-169)

- **Re-reviews continue the same conversation instead of being re-briefed.** The
  reviewer's session is resumed, so it verifies against findings it remembers
  making rather than a re-rendered list, and it re-reads the changed files from
  disk to check them. If a resume fails, flow-next rebuilds the prompt with the
  findings included and dispatches fresh — the fallback is loud and the ordering
  is deliberate, because a lean prompt reaching a context-free reviewer would be a
  fresh blind review with the prior findings silently dropped. Enabled for the
  codex backend, whose resume is verified across processes and after long gaps;
  copilot and cursor include the findings unconditionally, and the host backend
  always does, since every host re-review is a fresh subagent by design. (fn-169)

- **A review that cannot read its own evidence fails instead of running.** When the
  `git` read behind the scope map or the artifact identity fails, flow-next now
  stops with git's own error before reserving a review round. Previously it
  returned an empty result, which — with nothing embedded alongside — would
  dispatch a paid round with no evidence and leave the repeat-review guard reading
  "nothing changed" for every round after it. A range that genuinely contains no
  changes is still just empty. (fn-169)

- **The aggregate all-clear is trustworthy on every backend.** `Prior findings:
  all fixed` is a real shortcut, but it is only honest if the reviewer saw every
  prior finding — and the cursor backend used to fit its prompt to a hard argv
  budget, so it could show a reviewer only *some* of them and then sweep findings
  it never saw. fn-168 withheld the sweep on that backend as an interim measure;
  this release removes the truncation instead, so every reviewer sees its whole
  prior set and the shortcut is sound everywhere. Per-finding lines keep working
  as before, since they name the finding they resolve. (fn-168, fn-169)

- **Stall detection reads what the reviewer said instead of guessing from
  trends.** The two rules that inferred non-convergence — one from the open-count
  and severity trend, one from "each of the last two rounds raised a new
  blocker", which is what a healthy thorough review looks like — are **removed**.
  They produced three false escalations and no true ones. What remains is the
  reviewer explicitly marking the same finding unfixed twice, plus the round cap.
  The trade is deliberate: a loop that churns without repeating a finding is now
  bounded by the cap rather than detected early, which costs rounds instead of
  producing a wrong verdict. Reach for the cap, not a new trend rule — the
  reasoning is recorded in `.flow/memory/knowledge/decisions/`. (fn-168)

### Added

- **`review.maxIterations` — the review-round cap is now a project setting.**
  It was environment-only, so tuning it meant threading a variable through every
  pilot tick, land run, and manual invocation with nothing persisted. Set it once
  with `flowctl config set review.maxIterations <n>`; the `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS`
  environment variable still wins, the minimum is 1 on both paths, and the cap
  can never be disabled. Under Ralph, raising it is human-only: the guard blocks
  the config write (including the parent-key JSON form), file-tool edits to
  `.flow/config.json`, and the environment assignment — closing a self-grant
  route that predated the setting. (fn-168)

## [flow-next 3.15.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Windows now runs the same test corpus as Linux and macOS — every file, no
  exceptions.** A change can no longer pass on two OSes and quietly regress the
  third: the CI workflow's Windows-only exclusion list is gone (fn-119 left six
  files behind it; before that, 29 of 87), and `windows-latest` runs the full
  discovered corpus green in parallel, serial, and shuffled order on the same
  commit as the Linux/macOS gates. Nothing was weakened to get there — no
  raised timeouts, no blanket platform skips, no broadened assertions; the one
  remaining skip is a filename Windows cannot represent, with a Windows-valid
  equivalent asserting the same behavior. The bugs the filter had been hiding
  were real and are fixed: locale-dependent text reads, non-portable path
  derivation, an unguarded POSIX-only permission check, backend subprocesses
  that could block forever on an inherited stdin no automated caller answers,
  and a test-runner timeout that killed only the direct child — so a grandchild
  holding the pipe stalled the whole suite on every platform. Concurrent
  tracker writes also stopped intermittently refusing a legitimate path on
  Windows (`resolve()` can return two spellings of the same directory under
  load; containment is now derived from a single resolve, with the symlink
  refusal unchanged). (fn-120)
- **Two Windows edge cases hardened during review of the above.** The test
  runner's Job Object handles are now declared pointer-width via
  `ctypes.wintypes` (an unannotated handle can silently truncate on 64-bit
  Windows, invalidating the process-tree kill exactly when it's needed), and
  tracker path containment now rejects NTFS junctions and all other
  reparse points during its no-follow walk — junctions aren't symlinks, so the
  symlink check alone couldn't see a write escaping `.flow/` through one.
  Both carry POSIX-runnable regression tests. (fn-120, PR #291 review)

## [flow-next 3.15.0] - 2026-08-04

Flow-next got dramatically cheaper to carry. Benchmark evidence (SlopCodeBench,
16 checkpoints against a no-flow control) showed exactly where the overhead
lived: ceremony call count, re-anchor context, and one class of quality miss —
untested error paths. This release attacks all three: authoring a spec with its
full task set drops from ~20 flowctl calls to 8, a cold session orients in one
bounded call instead of dragging full spec bodies into context, and the specs
your agents write now enumerate their error cases up front so the work stage
inherits them as required tests.

### Added

- **Authoring a spec with its full task set now takes two flowctl calls instead
  of ~eight.** `spec create --plan-file plan.md` (or `--plan -`) creates the
  spec and applies the plan in one shot; `task create --from-json tasks.json`
  materializes every task of a plan — titles, descriptions, acceptance,
  satisfies, deps (including references between tasks in the same batch) — in a
  single call under one lock, all-or-nothing: any invalid item rejects the
  whole batch with zero writes. The canonical spec-plus-3-tasks flow drops from
  ~20 invocations to 8, verified by a test that counts real subprocess calls.
  Every teaching surface (plan skill, usage.md, setup snippets, CLI reference)
  now leads with the fast path; the granular verbs are unchanged and remain the
  editing path. Receipts, evidence, and start/done validation are untouched.
  (fn-163)

- **A cold session now orients with one call.** `flowctl brief` gives a fresh
  agent — a new chat, a pilot tick, a benchmark checkpoint — the whole
  workspace picture in a single bounded read: open specs with one-line goals,
  actionable tasks with claim state, the last five completions with evidence
  flags, the memory index, and pointers for going deeper. Output is
  deterministic and capped at ~2k tokens no matter how big the repo gets
  (explicit truncation markers, `--full` to lift, `--json` for the machine
  form), so re-anchoring stops dragging full spec bodies into context every
  session. Task-scope `flowctl anchor` is unchanged — brief is the
  session-scope sibling, and the setup snippets now teach brief-first as the
  cold-session default. Under the hood: no git subprocess and no writes —
  identical `.flow/` state always renders identical bytes. (fn-164)

- **The specs your agents write now enumerate their error cases up front.**
  Every benchmark checkpoint the pipeline lost traced to a single untested
  error path that "all tests green" then entrenched forever — so the fix moved
  upstream to plan time. Each acceptance criterion now states its
  error/invalid-input/boundary handling inside the R-ID bullet (or records "no
  error surface beyond X" — a one-line declaration is complete, silence is
  not), the plan skill derives those cases during AC writing, the interview
  asks the error-surface probe when they're missing, and workers inherit every
  enumerated case as a required test before `done`. Existing specs are
  untouched; the discipline applies to new specs only. (fn-165)

## [flow-next 3.14.0] - 2026-08-04

Review loops now end the way a human lead would end them: converging work gets
its room, a loop that has stopped improving reaches you early instead of
burning its whole budget, and a reviewer facing a genuine judgment call can
hand it to you directly - with the full evidence trail intact. The 4→8 cap
raise that shipped in 3.13.3 was the interim measure; this is the mechanism it
promised.

### Added

- **Stuck review loops reach you early instead of burning the full budget.**
  The deterministic cap still counts dispatches, but it now also reads the
  structured findings each verdict already persists and ends a loop that has
  measurably stopped converging: an open finding chain that two consecutive
  rounds fail to resolve, open severity and count both failing to improve, or
  each fix introducing a fresh P0/P1. The loop exits `4` with
  `ESCALATE: review loop stalled (<rule>)` - same exit code and marker family
  drivers already handle, no logic changes needed. Detection is fail-inert:
  missing, legacy, malformed, or truncated findings never manufacture a false
  stall.
- **Reviewers can hand a judgment call to a human.** A new terminal verdict,
  `NEEDS_HUMAN`, means "a human must adjudicate" - distinct from `NEEDS_WORK`
  (fixable) and `MAJOR_RETHINK` (redesign). It is accepted on every backend and
  the host path, writes a real `needs_human` status plus its receipt before the
  workflow exits `4` with `ESCALATE: reviewer requested human review`, so
  drivers see durable state, never a silent stop. Prompts spell out the
  distinction so it cannibalizes neither neighboring verdict.
- **Repeat reviews stop wasting rounds on an unchanged artifact.** Dispatching
  the same content that just received a verdict is refused before it costs
  anything: `NOT_RETRYABLE: artifact unchanged since last verdict` (exit `1`,
  nothing consumed). The identity is domain-separated per surface - plan hashes
  spec + tasks, impl hashes the dispatched diff, completion hashes spec + tasks
  + diff + global criteria - so a completion re-review after an
  implementation-only fix dispatches cleanly. `SHIP` and an explicit human
  re-plan start a fresh hash epoch; hash-compute failure fails open (the guard
  is a waste-saver, never a review-blocker).

### Changed

- **Each review surface now blocks on what it can actually break.** Plan
  review blocks only on findings that name a concrete bad downstream outcome -
  outcome-free prose polish is FYI, not a round-consumer. Impl review treats
  decisions recorded in the spec's Decision Context as settled (FYI, never
  re-litigated). The land-loop PR bot gets scope guidance in its trigger
  comment and its prose findings are triaged fix-or-record, never
  merge-gating - a bounded safety net, not a second plan-review gate.
- **The convergence ratchet argues from data, not prose.** Re-review context is
  rendered from the validated structured findings (severity, status,
  classification, lineage) instead of an 8000-char prose blob, with labeled
  legacy prose only as fallback. Its shrink-only contract is unchanged.
- **Autonomous loops cannot grant themselves more review rounds.** All the new
  terminals are shorten-only - nothing can raise, refund, or disable the cap -
  and ralph-guard blocks `spec reset-review-rounds`, `review-rounds reset`, and
  `--force` on review dispatch as human-only recovery tools. Worst case remains
  exactly `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` real dispatches.

### Under the hood

- `flowctl review-artifact plan|impl|completion` builds the domain-separated
  artifact blob; `flowctl rp mode-probe` reports RepoPrompt CE/Classic
  availability side-effect-free so RP workflows reserve immediately before
  dispatch. `review-rounds increment` gains `--review-type`,
  `--artifact-sha256`/`--artifact-file`, and `--force`, and returns a
  reservation id; `record` consumes it via `--reservation-id` after journaling
  receipt/status work (crash-safe replay). Attempt rows gain additive
  `artifact_sha256`, `forced`, `hash_epoch`, `reservation_id`, `finalized`, and
  `findings_digest` fields; spec state gains a per-scope `review_hash_epoch`
  map. `needs_human` joins the review-status enums. No schema breaks; existing
  readers ignore the new fields.

## [flow-next 3.13.3] - 2026-08-03

Run Codex from more than one home and flow-next can now live in all of them.
Plus review loops get twice the room before they stop and ask you to look.


### Changed

- **Codex installs now honor `CODEX_HOME`.** Run `CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex-work" ./scripts/install-codex.sh` once for each alternate Codex home; generated skills and agents now resolve their bundled tools from that same home at runtime. Installer progress and cleanup messages name the real destination, while an unset `CODEX_HOME` keeps the existing `~/.codex` behavior.

- **Review loops get twice the room before they stop and ask for you.**
  `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` defaults to **8** instead of 4. The cap counts review
  *dispatches*, which cannot tell a loop that is genuinely stuck from one that
  is converging while each fix surfaces one more small thing. In a single
  session three specs hit the cap at 4, and every time the findings left were
  trivial residue - two were reset by hand and shipped almost immediately
  after, one on the very next round. Eight buys room for that pattern without
  removing the stop the counter exists for: it still refuses to dispatch at the
  cap, still exits `4` with `ESCALATE:`, and still resets only on a `SHIP`
  verdict or an explicit `flowctl spec reset-review-rounds`. Set
  `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` yourself to go higher or lower; it can never be zero
  or disabled. This is an interim measure - the real fix is a convergence-aware
  terminal that reads the severity trend and can escalate to a human on
  purpose, rather than a bigger number.

## [flow-next 3.13.2] - 2026-08-02

Three chart defects that all failed the same way - silently. A reopened chart
could not get back to capture, a supersession could wire a replacement to the
premise it had just superseded, and an ambiguous initial map resolved edges to
the wrong decision. None of them raised, none logged; each persisted a chart
that looked correct and answered every later question from the wrong state.
Plus a CI change that is invisible to anyone running flow-next: the repo's own
test runner now uses the whole build machine.


Reopening a chart no longer costs you the way back to capture. `chart reopen`
does not re-open the decisions, so a finished chart is ready to brief again the
moment it reopens - and asking for that briefing, same proposal over an
unchanged ledger, used to hand back the briefing the reopen had just staled and
call it a no-op. You were left with a chart reporting itself ready to brief, no
capture-ready package, no path to one, and nothing on screen saying why. A
reopen now counts as a new epoch, so the same proposal mints the next briefing
package and names what it supersedes.

### Fixed

- **Running the suite from a Cursor agent session keeps its local headroom.** Cursor sets `CI=1` in its agent shell, so CI detection alone would have handed the whole machine to the test runner on a developer box - starving the editor and the agent that the two-core reservation exists to protect. A non-empty `CURSOR_AGENT` now forces the local branch; hosted runners never set it, so real CI is unaffected.
- **A superseded premise no longer strands the decision that depends on it.**
  When one supersession cascaded through several resolved dependents, the
  cascade processed them in local D-number order, not premise-first. A
  dependent numbered ahead of its own premise was replaced first, so its
  replacement was wired to the premise the same cascade was about to supersede
  rather than to that premise's replacement. Nothing raised, nothing logged:
  the chart persisted a graph that looked correct and answered every later
  supersession, briefing, and capture question from the stale edge. Cascades
  now walk the dependency graph premise-first (Kahn's algorithm with a
  min-heap on the local D-number), so equal-eligibility decisions still emerge
  in ascending D-number and identical ordered inputs reproduce byte-identical
  `affected`, `cascade_open`, `cascade_resolved`, and `replacements` arrays.
  `--keep-dependents` is untouched - it keeps emitting dependents in
  local-number order from its own call site, so its public `--json` arrays are
  byte-identical to before.
- **An ambiguous initial map is refused instead of silently mis-wired.**
  `chart create --initial-map-file` resolves edges through one flat alias
  namespace - the ordinal `<n>`, the `d<n>` form, the full decision id, and an
  optional explicit `id` - and every one of those was a plain assignment where
  the last writer won. A decision supplying `id: "d7"` while D7 did not exist
  yet had its alias silently taken over when decision #7 registered its own
  generated `d7`, and every edge naming that alias then pointed at the wrong
  decision. Graph validation could not catch it: it runs on the
  already-resolved graph, where the mis-wiring looks perfectly valid. One
  alias claimed by two different decisions is now refused up front with a
  `validation` / `alias_collision` error naming the alias and both claimants
  (`first` is the incumbent, `second` the rejected one), documented in
  `docs/flowctl.md`. Legal input is unchanged: the same alias registered twice
  for the same decision is still idempotent - an explicit `id` equal to that
  decision's own generated alias keeps working - and an id that normalizes to
  the empty string is still ignored. A rejection makes no durable reservation
  and writes no file, so the next valid create still receives the same `fn-N`.
- **A reopened chart can always be briefed again.** `chart reopen` stales the
  existing briefing, which is right - it was written before the reopen. But
  briefing identity was computed from the chart revision, the proposal, and the
  rendered decision evidence, and from none of what a reopen changes, so
  re-running the same proposal over an unchanged ledger matched the staled
  package and echoed it back with `noop: true`. (Change a decision or its
  evidence first and the hash moved, so that route always minted normally; the
  stranded case is the one where nothing else changed - and a reopen alone is
  enough to make a finished chart briefable again.) Nothing hinted that a
  changed proposal was the only way out, and downstream surfaces that correctly
  gate capture on a `final` briefing rendered a door that could not open. The
  chart's reopen timestamp is now part of briefing identity, so a post-reopen
  re-brief takes the ordinary emission
  path: it mints `B(n+1)`, recomputes draft-versus-final from the live chart
  (a stale draft can never silently become `final`), rewrites the convenience
  copies in step with the sidecar, runs in the existing transaction and lock,
  and projects to the tracker like any other briefing. Charts that were never
  reopened keep byte-identical fingerprints - the key is omitted rather than
  hashed as null - so a B-ID minted by an earlier version still matches an
  identical retry after the upgrade, proven against a checked-in pre-fix
  sidecar fixture. A briefing whose status is `stale` is never returned as an
  idempotent answer even when its stored hash matches, so a sidecar written by
  an older binary or edited by hand cannot bring the echo back.

### Added

- **The briefing tells you what it just did.** A fresh emission that supersedes
  staled predecessors now reports them: `supersedes_stale` (array of B-IDs, in
  sidecar order) in the `--json` result, and `(supersedes stale B1)` on the
  human line, in place of the misleading `status=stale (noop)` the defect
  produced. Presence is the discriminator, so the key is absent from first
  emissions, idempotent retries, and error envelopes: every non-superseding
  response is byte-unchanged, and the only result whose shape changes is one
  that genuinely supersedes staled briefings. It reports the invocation only:
  per-briefing `status` in the chart sidecar's `briefings[]` stays the single
  source of truth for capture-readiness.

### Changed

- **The repo's own parallel test runner stops leaving CI cores idle.**
  `scripts/run_tests_parallel.py` reserved two cores unconditionally. That
  reservation exists for machines with a human on them - an editor, a language
  server, an agent - and a build machine has none of that. The default is now
  the full core count when `CI` is set (`1`/`true`/`yes`, case-insensitive) and
  unchanged (`cpu_count - 2`) everywhere else; absent, empty, `false`, `0` and
  anything unrecognized all mean local, and TTY state is deliberately not part
  of the signal. `--jobs` and `--serial` still override, in that order, and the
  file set is unchanged - no test selection, no path filters, nothing skipped.
  The runner also gains its first tests. Maintainer-only CI tooling: nothing
  changes for anyone installing or running flow-next.

## [flow-next 3.13.1] - 2026-08-01

Chart's entry condition now matches the test it was always applying, so a
direction with no finish line gets an honest refusal and a route instead of a
map that can never close.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:chart` names the test it always applied: can you say what
  "arrived" looks like?** Chart's premise is *destination known, route unknown*, but the
  documented entry condition ("one singular effort, oversized, unclear")
  admitted a theme. A direction like "make the CLI more deterministic" has no
  end state, so no Outcome can be stated, nothing can be ruled out of scope,
  and the map never closes. Chart now refuses that shape before spending a
  grounding pass, says what is missing, and offers the two real routes:
  narrow to one effort whose arrival is nameable, or run `/flow-next:prospect`
  when the actual question is which effort to pick. `/flow-next:guide` gains
  the matching matrix row, and the skill carries a worked example of the
  refusal plus the narrowing that makes the same idea chartable.

## [flow-next 3.13.0] - 2026-08-01

An oversized idea that is still wrapped in unknowns no longer has to become a
spec full of guesses or a series of meetings whose output evaporates.
`/flow-next:chart` turns discovery into a durable decision map: resolve one
decision at a time with real evidence (research, probe, eval, prototype,
interview, or unblocking task), keep reversals as struck-through history, and
hand capture a briefing package when nothing material remains to decide.
Chart is optional - skip it when intent is already stateable - and never
writes a spec or sets ready. `/flow-next:guide` routes the smallest
sufficient path so chart does not become a new mandatory stage.

An interrupted review can no longer leave your spec telling two different
stories. Previously, if a plan review died between its internal writes (a
crash, a Ctrl-C, an OOM), the attempt ledger could carry the new verdict
while `plan_review_status` still showed the old one - and the next pipeline
stage would trust the stale status. Now the in-process plan-review path
commits the attempt row, the status field, and the SHIP round-counter reset
as one atomic write, so the sidecar is always internally consistent.

### Added

- **`/flow-next:chart` - decision-map discovery for oversized ideas (fn-135).**
  One unshaped idea, one decision per invocation, adaptive re-chart after
  every answer. Bounded Grounding Snapshot before persistence; prototype
  decisions attach a throwaway artefact, record the human reaction, and
  never promote prototype code into implementation. Unattended types may
  advance under host `/loop` on the chart skill and park with
  `CHART_VERDICT=NEEDS_HUMAN` at attended ones; chart is never a pilot
  stage. Full `flowctl chart` store (create through briefing/link-spec),
  optional tracker lifecycle projection (`tracker.charts`), local-ledger
  URL re-entry via `chart locate`, and capture handoff that preserves
  D-ID/evidence links while applying criterion source tags only to newly
  authored acceptance criteria. Docs inventory test keeps pipeline,
  optionality, counts, CLI, and usage parity honest.
- **`/flow-next:guide` - prompt-first smallest-sufficient router.** Recommends
  one next workflow from the starting state (including when to chart,
  skip chart because the signal is absent, or take a smaller path despite
  residual risk). Stateless - no flowctl mutations.

### Fixed

- **Review sidecar write transaction (#279).** `record_review_attempt` can
  now fold the denormalized `<kind>_review_status` write and the SHIP
  round-counter reset into its single atomic sidecar write. The in-process
  plan-review path uses both; impl and completion reviews fold the SHIP cap
  reset (completion keeps its separate status write - receipt persistence
  before terminal status is a recovery contract). Transport failures never
  touch status. Each attempt row also gains a best-effort `head_sha` so the
  ledger records which commit a verdict reviewed. Authority rule documented
  in `docs/architecture.md`: `review_attempts[]` is the ledger,
  `*_review_status` is a read model, ledger wins on divergence. Reported by
  @sn-furali (#279) with a precise read of the write paths - thank you.

## [flow-next 3.12.0] - 2026-07-31

Your editor can now validate and autocomplete `.flow/config.json`. Flow-next
ships a published JSON Schema for the whole documented config surface, and
`flowctl init` wires it up for you - open the file in VS Code (or any
JSON-Schema-aware editor) and you get completion for every key, enum values
for knobs like `review.backend` and `pipeline.qa`, hover docs, and squiggles
on typos, instead of cross-checking the settings table by hand.

### Added

- **Published JSON Schema for `.flow/config.json` (fn-138).** A deterministic,
  pure-stdlib generator emits a draft 2020-12 schema covering all documented
  keys with descriptions, defaults, enums, and the `backend[:model[:effort]]`
  spec-grammar pattern. The committed artifact lives at
  `plugins/flow-next/schema/flow-config.schema.json` and is published at the
  stable URL `https://flow-next.dev/schema/flow-config.schema.json`
  (latest-mutable). Kept honest by tests, not by discipline: a drift test
  walks the config reader's accepted keys against the schema in both
  directions (a new config key without a schema entry fails the suite),
  schema `default` annotations are asserted equal to the code defaults, and
  valid/invalid fixture configs validate with a stdlib-only structural
  validator - no new dependency, no runtime validation in flowctl.
- **`flowctl init` stamps `$schema` into configs it writes.** Fresh scaffolds
  and re-init refreshes carry `"$schema": "https://flow-next.dev/schema/flow-config.schema.json"`
  as the first key; existing configs are untouched on every other path
  (`config set` round-trips the stamp, and an already-present `$schema`
  value always survives re-init). The URL is an inert string - flowctl never
  fetches it. Until the docs site publishes the URL, editors may show a
  transient "could not load reference" warning on the `$schema` line;
  validation picks up automatically once the schema is live.

### Fixed

- **flowctl.md settings table: corrected `memory.enabled` and
  `planSync.enabled` defaults.** Both were documented as `false`; the code
  default for each is `true`.

> Downstream walk (before the release announcement): publish
> `plugins/flow-next/schema/flow-config.schema.json` at
> `https://flow-next.dev/schema/flow-config.schema.json` on the docs site
> FIRST, so freshly stamped configs resolve their `$schema` reference on day
> one; then the docs-site changelog entry.

### Changed

- **Spec-authoring skills no longer duplicate standing criteria.** When
  `.flow/criteria.md` exists, `/flow-next:plan`, `/flow-next:capture`, and
  `/flow-next:refine` reference a relevant G-ID in prose instead of
  restating it as an R-ID - a copy would freeze while `criteria.md` evolves
  and get judged twice (once as the spec's R, once as the standing G at
  completion review). A spec writes an R-ID only for what it requires beyond
  the standing rule. Docs: `teams.md` § Standing criteria and
  `spec-template.md` § Global criteria.

## [flow-next 3.11.0] - 2026-07-31

A pull request can no longer earn land's trust just by *talking about* flow-next.
Land's autonomous babysitter now recognizes its own PRs by an invisible
structural marker instead of loose text matching, so a hand-written PR body
that merely mentions the tooling and a spec id is never classified as
build-loop-authored.

### Fixed

- **make-pr emits a machine marker; land's authorship probe matches structure,
  not mentions.** The PR-body footer now carries an invisible HTML comment
  (`<!-- flow-next:make-pr spec=<spec-id> base=<base-ref> -->`) alongside the
  visible breadcrumb, and land probes that marker first - prose discussing the
  `flow-next:make-pr` token cannot accidentally form a comment node. PRs from
  older make-pr versions fall back to an ANCHORED single-line footer match
  (token + spec id co-occurring in the `Generated by ...` line) instead of the
  previous two independent whole-body presence tests. Reported by @sn-furali
  (issue #274) with a precise analysis and honest blast-radius scoping -
  thank you.

### Added

- **`/flow-next:make-pr` — the PR-create call is now interposable via
  `FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD` (#277).** Repos that require App/bot-authored PRs — the
  canonical case: `required_approving_review_count: 1` with a single
  maintainer, where GitHub forbids self-approval and a human-authored PR is
  structurally unmergeable — can point the env var at a wrapper that supplies
  its own identity (e.g. mints a GitHub App installation token) instead of
  shimming `gh` on `PATH`. Default is `gh pr create`; unset means byte-for-byte
  the old behavior. The contract is documented inline at the seam
  (create-and-finalize.md §4.6) and is deliberately narrow: the command is
  invoked as `$FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD --title <t> --body-file <f> [--draft] --base
  <branch> --head <branch>` (whitespace-split, never eval'd), must exit 0 and
  print the PR URL on success, and gets its combined output surfaced verbatim
  on failure. Scope is CREATE only — authorship is fixed at creation; `gh pr
  view`/`gh pr edit`, the `--update` path, and the §4.6b repair still use `gh`,
  which remains a preflight requirement. Identity work stays the integrator's:
  flow-next does not mint tokens or know about GitHub Apps.
  Reported with an unusually precise diagnosis by @sn-furali.

### Fixed

- **`/flow-next:make-pr` — `PR_URL` is now extracted from the create output,
  not raw-assigned (#277).** §4.6 captured `CREATE_OUT=$(gh pr create … 2>&1)`
  and assigned the whole capture to `PR_URL`, so ANY stderr chatter — gh's own
  "a new release is available" upgrade notice was enough — corrupted the URL
  and the `${PR_URL##*/}` PR-number derivation the receipts and resolve-pr
  hints build on. The URL is now grep-extracted (`…/pull/<n>`, last match wins)
  from the combined output, which also frees `FLOW_PR_CREATE_CMD` wrappers from
  any stay-silent-on-success obligation; success with no URL anywhere in the
  output is a hard, labeled error instead of a silently poisoned variable.

## [flow-next 3.10.0] - 2026-07-31

Teams can now write their standing, project-wide acceptance criteria down once
and have every spec judged against them - no more relying on CLAUDE.md prose
and reviewer memory to enforce "every route change regenerates the contract"
or "no new dependency without a health check".

### Added

- **Standing project-wide acceptance criteria, applied by the review you
  already run.** Put team-wide rules in a plain markdown file,
  `.flow/criteria.md`, one bullet per criterion (`- **G1:** ...` - the
  familiar R-ID grammar with a `G` prefix, lifted to project scope; ids are
  stable, gaps allowed, scope hints live in the prose). The existing spec
  completion review - every backend: codex, copilot, cursor, rp, host - then
  judges each criterion against the whole spec's implementation, and
  compliance lands in the ordinary review receipt as an additive
  `criteria: [{id, status, note?}]` array (`met` / `violated` / `n/a`), with
  every violation also reported as a normal finding. No separate auditor
  fleet, no rule engine, no scoring math - the criteria are prose judged by
  the reviewer that already runs.
- **Opt-in from setup, invisible until adopted.** `/flow-next:setup` offers a
  one-question scaffold of `.flow/criteria.md` from a bundled template that
  documents the grammar with commented examples; declining leaves no trace,
  and an existing file is user content - never re-asked about, never touched.
  An absent file is a silent no-op everywhere: assembled review prompts carry
  zero criteria content and receipts carry no `criteria` field.
- **Deterministic plumbing, degrade-to-absent evidence.** `flowctl criteria
  list --json` parses and validates the file (unique ids, non-empty prose);
  `flowctl criteria prompt-block` prints the same injection block the
  subprocess backends get from the shared prompt builder, for the rp/host
  workflows. The receipt's compliance array is projected from the reviewer's
  `## Global criteria` output section by the same public boundary as the
  fn-136 findings parser: unparseable compliance degrades to absent, never an
  error, and legacy receipts stay valid. Docs: `spec-template.md` § Global
  criteria (G-ID grammar beside the R-ID rules), `review-findings.md` §
  Global-criteria compliance, `teams.md` § Standing criteria, `flowctl.md` §
  criteria.
- **A misconfigured criteria file can never silently disable your standing
  rules.** Sixteen cross-model review rounds hardened the input boundary: an
  existing-but-invalid `.flow/criteria.md` (typo'd bullets in any Markdown
  marker, zero/zero-padded or unicode-digit ids, duplicate ids, over-limit
  files, broken symlinks, unreadable content) fails closed with a diagnostic
  pointing at `flowctl criteria list` - before a review round is reserved -
  while an absent or valid-but-empty file stays a silent, zero-token no-op.
  Receipt-side, the reviewer's compliance section is strict: ambiguous or
  contradictory output degrades the array to absent rather than ever
  recording wrong compliance, and the criteria ids must exactly match the
  configured set before anything attaches.

Someone landing on the README now learns what Flow-Next does for them before
they meet a single mechanism, and they see that it runs in real engineering
organisations inside the first screenful instead of two thirds of the way down.

### Changed

- **The README leads with the problem, the measured evidence, and the outcomes
  you get.** The page opens on the reader's situation (implementation got cheap;
  reviewing and verifying it did not), then the SlopCodeBench findings as four
  scannable bullets instead of a dense statistics paragraph, then six outcome
  headings that state what you get rather than which mechanism produces it.
  Adoption and breadth evidence, including the honest asymmetry about who feels
  the change first, moved from two thirds down the page into the first quarter.
  Every section is retained; the seven-tenet vocabulary table and the command
  inventory are demoted behind a disclosure and a link to the generated
  catalog, so the narrative reads as an argument rather than a manual.
- **Natural-language invocation is stated as a first-class entry point.** Every
  skill runs from plain language and every argument has a plain-language
  equivalent, so a reader learns that before they learn the slash commands.

### Fixed

- **Which harnesses are first-class no longer depends on which page you read.**
  The README prose called Cursor and Grok Build "runs on" while the platforms
  table two hundred lines later called Cursor first-class and the docs site
  called all five first-class. `plugins/flow-next/docs/platforms.md` is now the
  single canonical home for one sentence ("First-class on Claude Code, OpenAI
  Codex, Factory Droid, Cursor, and xAI Grok Build. Community port for
  OpenCode."), and every other surface restates it verbatim or links there, so
  promoting or demoting a harness is a one-place edit.
- **Agent counts in the reference docs match what ships.** `platforms.md`
  claimed 22 agents in three places; the plugin ships 21. Inventory counts are
  gone from README front-door prose entirely, where they drift silently and
  earn the reader nothing, and the generated catalogs keep the exact numbers.

### Documentation

- README punctuation and ornament pass: em dashes and stray curly quotes
  replaced sentence by sentence, decorative emoji dropped from prose and from
  the mermaid diagram while the handful marking navigation links stay, and
  every relative link re-verified. Third-party quotations keep their authors'
  own punctuation.

## [flow-next 3.9.0] - 2026-07-31

Human reviewers can now follow a pull request as a deliberate journey through
the change instead of rebuilding the story from file order. Logical steps
explain their purpose, group the files that belong together, name deliberate
non-changes, and attach evidence, while the independent review plan keeps human
attention on the risky decisions.

### Added

- **Pull requests now explain the change in the order a reviewer needs to
  understand it.** Each source-grounded step carries its purpose, exact file
  membership, R-ID/task links, deliberate non-changes, and aligned
  verification. The risk-ranked review plan remains separate, so the journey
  explains how the work fits together while the plan tells the human where
  judgment matters. Under the hood, Make PR persists the walkthrough as a
  head-bound portable v1 object and renders the same meaning through structured
  JSON, GitHub Markdown, and optional HTML. A maximum-normal canonical fixture,
  SHA-256 metadata, information-architecture references, and an offline
  byte-pinned Flow Swarm contract define downstream compatibility.

- **The richer handover stays negligible beside the review itself.**
  Both the maximum-item findings parser and maximum-normal cognitive-aid
  validation/render path enforce a strict `<100 ms p95` ceiling over 30 warm
  measurements. This supersedes the original 50 ms target after a representative
  parallel-suite observation of 90.57 ms. Fixture metadata and consumer
  contracts pin the exclusive bound.

- **Opening the optional HTML view no longer makes its review evidence stale.**
  Make PR persists the head-bound structured object before optional HTML,
  embeds a lossless script-safe semantic carrier, and keeps the current lens
  local-only so `HEAD` remains unchanged. Only a visibly labeled legacy
  fallback may use the narrow artifact commit.

- **Review findings keep their identity across fix rounds.** A reviewer or
  downstream tool can distinguish current, resolved, and superseded findings
  and trace each one back to the review that raised it. Plan, implementation,
  completion, and QA receipts may carry optional versioned structured findings
  with canonical severity, confidence, classification, status, lineage, and
  optional snapshot-bound anchors.
  Head-current selection rejects broken or ambiguous chains; unsupported
  versions, unknown enums, unsafe or oversized data, and unparseable reviewer
  prose fall back to the original receipt and prose without raising or
  truncating. No extra model or network call is introduced.

### Fixed

- **RepoPrompt CE reviews now start and continue in the context CE actually
  returns.** Reviewers get the normal Flow verdict, receipt, and same-context
  fix loop without a hidden second setup conversation or dependency on a
  Classic-style visible tab. Under the hood, one `context_builder` call with
  `response_type=review` supplies the prompt, formatted selection, file/token
  counts, context/chat identities, and response. Setup validates that direct
  result, rejects blank input, and feeds the response into the normal review
  path. Discontinued Classic remains an isolated final fallback; CE failures
  never downgrade. Setup/cap failures finalize their reserved round, and later
  passes bind the returned canonical context and chat identities.

## [flow-next 3.8.0] - 2026-07-30

People reviewing interview-authored specs can now tell which acceptance
criteria came from a human and which ones the agent inferred. The same
provenance signal already available after Capture now survives the PO and
technical interview journey, making grounded claims easy to separate from
guesses before implementation starts.

### Changed

- **Interview-authored criteria now say where they came from.** Capture has
  always stamped provenance on every criterion (`[user]` / `[paraphrase]` /
  `[inferred]` / `[strategy:<track>]`), but interview emitted nothing - so the
  grounded-vs-guessed tally and the targeted "re-interview only the `[inferred]`
  items" pattern silently returned empty on any interview-authored spec, which is
  most of them for teams using the symmetric PO -> tech-lead flow. Interview now
  emits the same four tags at all three write-back sites, with `[user]` meaning
  the PO under a business pass and the tech lead under a technical one. A pass
  tags only the criteria it authors and never retags an existing bullet, so
  provenance is frozen exactly like the R-ID number; untagged criteria mean
  unknown provenance, never `[user]`. Capture's no-self-blessing rule is
  inherited, narrowed to `[inferred]` criteria that no question covered. Tag
  definitions are repeated at the emission sites rather than centralised
  (relocating them regressed accuracy once before) and a test pins the vocabulary
  as set-equality across both skills, so a renamed, dropped, or added tag fails
  CI in either direction. No parser or CLI change: the tag format was already
  source-agnostic.

### Fixed

- **The published source-tag tally recipe dropped every `[strategy:*]`
  criterion.** The recipe shipped in 3.7.0 used the character class `[a-z:]+`,
  but a track name keeps its literal casing and may contain spaces or hyphens
  (`[strategy:Cross-platform parity]`), so those criteria never matched. The
  `awk` stage had a second, quieter version of the same bug: with the default
  whitespace split, a spaced track name landed in the wrong field and produced a
  phantom tag. Corrected in the repo docs and on flow-next.dev to `[^]]+` with a
  tab-delimited `awk -F'\t'`, and the reason is documented inline so it does not
  regress.

## [flow-next 3.7.0] - 2026-07-29

Teams can now shape the spec around their own domain and have Interview fill
those project-specific sections without losing or silently ignoring them. A
scope marker makes ownership explicit, while unmarked sections stay frozen.

### Changed

- **Interview now fills the spec sections your project adds.**
  `flowctl scope write-policy` enumerates the seven canonical sections only, so
  a section a project added via its own repo-root `SPEC.md` scaffold appeared in
  neither its `writable` nor its `preserved` list. The interview prose asked the
  agent to think in terms of that closed list, which left custom sections with
  no stated protection and no route to ever being filled. Ownership now comes
  from the section's own scope-owner marker in the spec body, with a three-way
  rule: a marker naming this pass's scope makes the section **writable** (filled
  and refined like a canonical section), a marker naming the other scope
  preserves it byte-for-byte, and no marker (or an unparseable one) preserves it
  byte-for-byte and says so in the read-back. `scope: both` is writable under
  any pass. Absence from the write-policy lists is explicitly never permission
  to drop a section. Scope-owner markers, previously strippable as authoring
  guidance, must now be **kept on project-added sections** because for those the
  marker is the only ownership signal a later pass has. Prose only - no
  `flowctl` change, no new command surface, no version bump.

### Documentation

- **Customizing the spec scaffold is now properly documented.** The repo-root
  `SPEC.md` override has always won the 4-tier discovery cascade, but it was
  documented only as a lookup order - so the most useful thing about it, that a
  project can impose its own spec shape without forking the plugin, was easy to
  miss. `plugins/flow-next/docs/spec-template.md` gains a "Customizing the
  scaffold for your project" guide: how to do it, what is free to change
  (adding sections, reordering, rewriting the guidance prose under any
  heading), and a verified table of what silently degrades if you rename or
  remove `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Boundaries`, `## Goal & Context` or
  `## Decision Context`. Also documents a known limitation: `flowctl scope
  write-policy` enumerates only the seven canonical sections, so a
  user-added section has no contractual byte-for-byte preservation guarantee
  under an `interview` pass (`capture` and `plan` are unaffected). The bundled
  template and `CLAUDE.md` cross-link the guide. Docs only - no behavior
  change, no version bump.

## [flow-next 3.6.1] - 2026-07-29

When Flow and an external tracker disagree about status, the conflict policy
the team chose now decides the outcome. Sync no longer stalls because the
setting was documented but ignored, and impossible state transitions remain
visible for human resolution.

### Fixed

- **Tracker status conflicts now follow the team's chosen policy.** The shared
  deterministic path consumes `always-ask`, `flow-wins`, and `tracker-wins`
  across direct status and lifecycle-facade calls. Flow wins through the
  existing provider-neutral write path; a terminal tracker wins through the
  existing local fold and `pulled` receipt. The unrepresentable mirror — a
  merged Flow spec against an active tracker — remains an explicit
  candidate-bearing conflict with no mutation. Malformed persisted values now
  fail with `INVALID_INPUT` before claims or sequence work, and invalid
  `config set` values are rejected. Fixes #268.

## [flow-next 3.6.0] - 2026-07-29

Tracker updates now behave consistently across GitHub, GitLab, Linear, and Jira,
including retries, dependency links, status transitions, and partial failures.
This release publishes that already-shipped behavior under the correct minor
version; there is no additional runtime change from 3.5.2.

### Changed

- **The reliable cross-provider tracker path now has the correct release
  signal.**
  The fn-139/fn-140/fn-141 batch replaces tracker-sync's provider mutation
  prose with the deterministic `flowctl tracker` wire, lifecycle, status,
  relation, body-sync, and facade layers across GitHub, GitLab, Linear, and
  Jira. This is the semver-correct publication of the substantial behavior
  already present in 3.5.2; there is no additional runtime delta between
  3.5.2 and 3.6.0 beyond the version metadata. The 3.5.2 release and changelog
  remain intact as historical records of the prematurely classified artifact.

## [flow-next 3.5.2] - 2026-07-29

> Superseded the same day by 3.6.0 so the tracker-determinism batch is
> classified as a minor release. The published 3.5.2 artifact remains intact.

### Added

- **Deterministic tracker verb surface** (`flowctl tracker ...`, fn-140, spec B of the tracker-determinism batch). The tracker-sync prose workflows now have a deterministic Python backend in `flowctl_tracker/`: locator-addressed wire verbs (`read`/`update`/`comment`/`label`/`assign`/`attach`/`list-open`), lifecycle verbs (`create`, `create-first`, `persist-external`), `status` (fn-66 merge-evidence gate decides; `--to` is a request), `relate` (two-phase depRelations ledger, additive-only), `sync-body` (server readback is the canonical tracker half; paired merge base committed atomically), and the `sync` facade (`push|pull|reconcile|comment` as one unit with create-if-unlinked, native-title projection on push/reconcile, marker dedup, and one aggregate receipt). All four adapters (GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira) run behind a never-raises boundary with structured `degraded` evidence, honest pagination (`truncated`, never silent absence), per-spec operation claims under the shared writer lock, and identity guards that refuse to persist across a mid-flight relink. Verified by a cross-adapter conformance matrix with fault injection plus a live smoke against all four trackers.

### Changed

- **Tracker determinism batch completed** (fn-139, fn-140, fn-141). Provider request execution moved from skill prose into the zero-dependency `flowctl_tracker/` package, with injected transport boundaries, bounded responses, deterministic error classification, scoped `tracker.resolved` destination and capability snapshots, and distribution parity across bundled installs. `flowctl tracker` now owns normalized wire verbs, lifecycle verbs, and the composed `sync` facade; lifecycle callers retain their bridge-active and `perEvent` gates, compose semantic content in private input files, and make one facade call with one aggregate receipt. The tracker-sync skill is reduced to five named judgment surfaces: host MCP continuation, discovery choices, semantic 3-way body conflict adjudication, comment content synthesis, and recovery routing from structured classes. The retired `tracker-runner` and runtime transport-selection recipes are gone. The immutable fn-130 B1 baseline remains untouched; the post-teardown candidate records 452,552 to 137,920 reached-path characters across all 15 tracker fixtures, a 69.52% reduction by design. This deliberately supersedes fn-57 R3's prohibition on tracker mutations in flowctl.
- **Autonomous skill seams now continue explicitly instead of reading like terminal handoffs.** Pilot and Work forced-reference gates, review backend returns, and post-task dispatches direct the host to continue the same invocation. Work recognizes all four headless-autonomy markers before delegation consent, while interactive consent still asks and persists normally. Plan Review keeps host-only mechanics cold until the host backend is selected. Genuine terminal verdicts, receipts, sandbox authority, and non-host backend behavior are unchanged.
- **`/flow-next:resolve-pr` now audits confirmed bot findings for sibling instances in the same cycle.** After proving an automated-review finding valid, the resolver states the violated invariant, inspects adjacent call sites that perform the same operation/state transition/shared-helper path, and fixes plus regression-tests every confirmed sibling before returning. The scan stops at evidence — no speculative search-and-replace or unrelated refactor — and complements rather than weakens the existing cross-round cluster gate.

### Fixed

- **Make PR tracker links survive the deterministic tracker rewrite.** The
  lifecycle reconcile facade now accepts the explicit PR URL for `makePr` and
  projects the provider-native non-closing link in the same claim and receipt:
  GitHub PR-body reference, deduplicated GitLab note, Jira remote-link upsert
  with comment fallback, or Linear rich URL attachment. The reached-path
  candidate utility also reports relative and out-of-repository `--output`
  paths without failing after a successful write.
- **Worktree Kit no longer exposes nested worktrees to `git add -A` as broken
  gitlinks.** `create` initializes a self-contained, non-clobbering
  `.worktrees/.gitignore` (`*` plus `!.gitignore`) before adding the worktree,
  preserving an existing custom ignore file and leaving the repository root
  `.gitignore` untouched. Thanks @sn-furali for reporting
  [#266](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/266).
- **Backlog-mode tracker operations are executable after the tracker prose teardown.** `flowctl tracker wire relation-list` now returns normalized directed dependency rows for Linear, GitHub, GitLab, and Jira, including GitHub's explicit hierarchy degradation and GitLab block/link provenance; capped pagination fails closed instead of exposing a partial graph. `flowctl tracker wire question` computes a stable question id from semantic identity fields, reads comments before writing, and idempotently parks tracker-only questions without requiring a Flow spec.
- **Tracker status recovery and review-attempt finalization.** A native-open GitHub or GitLab issue now wins over a stale terminal `status:*` label left by a manual reopen. GitHub status writes make one bounded cleanup pass when separate label operations leave an ambiguous namespace; persistent ambiguity remains retryable without advancing durable sync state, and a later invocation re-enters the ordinary policy and merge-evidence gates before replaying the idempotent label repair. GitLab readiness validation drains every bounded label-search page before declaring `tracker.readyState` stale. Host and RepoPrompt review workflows now stop on attempt-recorder or completion-status write failures; the same recorder-exit guard covers Plan Review and Implementation Review sibling paths.
- **Tracker lifecycle and relation edge cases found during PR review.** Jira relation projection now resolves `tracker.perTracker.blocksLinkType` (or discovers a blocks-semantics type) once and uses it for both dedup and creation; sites with no matching type queue instead of forcing stock `Blocks`. Jira create checks createmeta and omits Description only when the selected create screen positively excludes it, seeds both base halves from the actual empty write so the local body remains pending, and carries the structured degradation through facade receipts. Create and update readbacks must still match the provider's mutation acknowledgement before they can become a paired ancestor, preventing a concurrent remote edit from being recorded as synchronized. `persist-external` refuses a concurrent durable relink even when the display identifier is unchanged and now holds its spec claim through receipt creation and idempotent retry. Create and create-first release owned claims after unexpected adapter exceptions instead of wedging retries. Pull holds its facade identity claim through aggregate receipt creation, and `sync set-tracker-id` promotes identifier-only links to `linked` when a durable ID is installed. Converged retries now recreate missing event receipts across status, sync-body, and relate without repeating provider mutations or advancing `lastSyncedAt`. Facade push now accepts the exact local flow body and the agent-rendered tracker body separately, preserving a comparable `mergeBaseFlow` while writing tracker-form content. Every legacy sync-state setter now shares the writer lock and refuses live deterministic-operation claims, preventing stale whole-sidecar writes from erasing a committed transaction. GitHub status reasons now pair with their normalized slots: `not_planned` only with `cancelled`, `completed`/`duplicate` only with `done`; GitHub/GitLab active-status writes preserve the canonical hyphenated labels. Source-repository PR evidence no longer inherits tracker-specific TLS policy. Linear attachment-create failures retain evidence for the already-landed asset upload. `sync clear` shares the config writer lock and refuses every live spec operation claim, matching relink safety. Merge evidence probes the current code checkout rather than an out-of-tree GitHub issue destination. Sync-body rejects multiple or unbalanced `flow:deps` regions before pull/base-seeding or push rewriting. Canonical Jira direction docs now match the live-measured wire shape: blocker B is `inwardIssue`, blocked A is `outwardIssue`.
- **Repeatable tracker comments keep distinct lifecycle evidence.** Every
  synthesized facade comment now requires a stable, caller-owned
  `evidence=<token>` first line; missing or placeholder evidence fails before
  provider I/O instead of collapsing later task/review/QA occurrences onto one
  shared marker. GitLab relation reads also preserve a native
  `is_blocked_by` row when the same edge appears in Flow's body block, rather
  than relabeling the native link as a degraded `relates_to` fallback.
- **`--validate` silently stopped reading `validate-pass.md` (regression from 3.4.x).** The fn-112 prompt-to-template extraction deleted the `VALIDATOR_TEMPLATE_REL` constant but left its use site in `load_validator_template()`. The lookup raised `NameError` straight into a bare `except Exception: pass`, so the repo-root branch never resolved and copy-mode installs fell through to the embedded condensed fallback. Review at the time caught the sibling `VALIDATOR_TEMPLATE_FALLBACK` deletion and restored it; this one went unnoticed. The constant is restored, so copy-mode installs read the full on-disk prompt again, exactly as they did before the extraction. Plugin-mode installs were never affected. No prompt text changed.
- Two further undefined names: `Iterator` used in a string annotation but never imported, and a test base class expression that always fell through to `unittest.TestCase`.

### Added

- **Ruff gate in CI** (`ruff.toml`, pinned `ruff==0.16.0`). Correctness-only ruleset - pyflakes, bugbear, pylint errors, a few security and bug-pattern rules. Ruff 0.16 enables 413 rules by default where 0.15 enabled 59; the pin is deliberate, since an unpinned `ruff` turns that into an unannounced CI break. Style rules are out of scope on purpose, and `ruff.toml` records why each excluded rule was excluded. The install copy under `.flow/`, the generated Codex mirror, and the test fixtures are excluded so `--fix` can never write into them. CI path filters cover every path the gate lints.
- **`test_prompt_text_pinned.py`** - SHA-256 tripwire over every embedded prompt constant and on-disk prompt template. Lint, format, and refactor passes must not alter prompt text as a side effect; if one does, this fails loudly instead of hiding in a large diff. Deliberate prompt edits update the hash in the same commit.

## [flow-next 3.5.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **The sandbox error no longer teaches agents to widen the reviewer sandbox.** `flowctl <backend> impl-review` / `plan-review` answered a sandbox-blocked reviewer with "Try `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or auto) or set `CODEX_SANDBOX=danger-full-access`". Reviewers are read-only by contract, so that path is a prompt/scope bug, not a permissions problem, and the suggested remedy is wrong everywhere except Windows (where `auto` already resolves it). Observed downstream effect: agents pattern-matched unrelated review failures onto the remedy and narrated a delivered `VERDICT=NEEDS_WORK` as "fundamentally a transport issue" needing a sandbox retry - a state the code cannot produce, since a parsed verdict returns before transport classification and consumes the round. The message now names the contract violation, refuses the widen, keeps the Windows carve-out, and states that no round was consumed.
- **Anti-pattern rule added to all three review skills** (`impl-review`, `plan-review`, `spec-completion-review`): a delivered verdict is never a transport failure, and the reviewer sandbox is never widened. Closes the loophole the fn-134 refund vocabulary opened, where re-framing a `NEEDS_WORK` as transport is the cheapest way for an agent to dodge a consumed round.
- Plan-review reached-path ratchet evidence refreshed for the added contract prose (+364 chars per route; every route still reduced, `none`/`export` 77.91%).

## [flow-next 3.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`tracker.specIds` + synthetic tracker keys + create-first (fn-134).** Team default id scheme when a tracker is configured: `flowctl config set tracker.specIds tracker` routes new specs to tracker-keyed ids (Linear/Jira native `KEY-N-slug`; GitHub `#N` → `gh-N-slug`; GitLab project-scoped `iid` → `gl-N-slug`). Synthetic keys are guarded by contextual `gh`/`gl` prefix reservation while `tracker.type` matches plus a preflight of the existing store. Fresh-idea path: tracker-sync **create-first** (title+body, no local spec) with pre-spec recovery under `.flow/create-first/` (gitignored; retry links, never re-creates). Setup asks the id-scheme question when a tracker is configured and the key is still unset. Notable updates surface seeded on `plugins/flow-next/docs/README.md`.
- **`flowctl task set-title`** — updates JSON `title` and markdown H1 together so they cannot disagree (fn-134 incidental).

### Fixed

- **Workspace containment for `create-first` recovery writes (security).** A repository is untrusted input: an attacker-supplied checkout could ship `.flow/create-first` or `.flow/.gitignore` as a symlink and have `flowctl sync create-first-put` write through it. Three variants were reproduced before fixing — out-of-tree (record written outside the repo), in-tree to another managed file (`.flow/config.json` overwritten with ignore rules), and a symlinked directory component (records written into `.flow/specs/`). Every component from the leaf up to the resolved `.flow` is now checked, and any symlink among them is refused. A legitimately symlinked `.flow` itself remains supported.
- **`create-first` sequence hardening.** The recovery record is released last (after the back-reference write, then the receipt); attach, merge-base seeding and `set-last-synced` each abort the sequence rather than falling through to the cleanup that would discard the recovery state; a resumed run reuses the recorded `specId` instead of re-minting, and re-validates that the spec is still unlinked before attaching. A custom Jira DC/Server key (`MY_PROJECT-7`), which is display-only by design, degrades to flow-first **plus attach** instead of looping on a mint that can never succeed.
- **Named-issue mints now attach.** All five spec-creating sites (capture, plan, work, interview, QA promotion) follow a named-issue mint with the fetch/attach/seed ceremony. Minting stores `tracker.identifier` but not the durable `tracker.id`, so without it a later lifecycle touchpoint treated the spec as unlinked and created a **second** remote issue.
- **Flow-first degradation is reachable.** The fallback sat in an `else` arm that could never run when `create-first` returned a noop, so spec creation aborted when no transport was reachable. It is now an unconditional post-check, guarded so it never fires once a remote issue exists (which would orphan it).
- **Task H1 handling.** Locating the task heading now ignores YAML frontmatter, fenced and indented code, requires column-zero markers and delimiters, understands CRLF and bare-CR line endings, preserves the original line terminator on rewrite, and targets the task's own heading — the read and write paths agree.
- **Allocation monotonicity.** The ref scan passes `--full-history`; without it git's pathspec simplification pruned merged side branches (measured on this repo: 285 vs 287 observed adds), so a retired `fn-N` could be handed out again.
- **`task create` / `task set-title` reject multiline titles**, which would otherwise split the JSON title and the markdown H1 apart.

### Changed

- **Union-source `fn-N` allocation + duplicate ordinal as `root_warnings` (fn-134).** Native allocation takes the max across the working tree, every registered worktree, and every ref (monotonic, fail-open). Duplicate ordinals with distinct full ids are top-level `root_warnings` (counted in `total_warnings`), not `root_errors`. Docs corrected: GitHub/GitLab support tracker-first via synthetic keys (no longer "flow-first only").

## [flow-next 3.4.5] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- **Opus 5 routing guidance pinned to medium effort - measured, not hedged.**
  The model-routing scaffold, this repo's CLAUDE.md block, and the
  orchestration docs now say `opus-5 @ med`: the Opus 5 model card's own
  FrontierCode figures peak at medium and degrade through high/xhigh
  (Fig 8.4.A/B, Cognition-scored), and a complete opus-5@medium-conducted
  pilot-to-land run on this repo (fn-122 -> PR #239) chained plan,
  plan-review, work, make-pr, and land cleanly with every verdict line
  artifact-verified. Community reports of Opus 5 stopping early in
  skill-chained workflows did not reproduce against flow-next's verdict-line
  and receipt contracts.

### Added

- **`Harden` — a sixth `/flow-next:audit` outcome that graduates a recurring
  lesson into an enforced gate (fn-122).** Memory entries that keep getting
  re-taught are the ones that should stop riding the context window: when an
  entry is correct, recurring, and mechanizable, the audit now proposes turning
  it into a lint rule, a CI step, or a rule in the substantive
  `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Recurrence is measured from the artifacts that
  actually exist - `## Update` heading count and entry-file commit count
  (there is no read-side usage telemetry, and the docs say so). The gate is
  **verified live** before the lesson is retired: a resolved lint config, a job
  that actually runs, the instruction file agents really read. Verification
  failure leaves the entry `active` and reports a failed graduation - a gate
  that does not fire is worse than no gate. Harden never auto-applies in
  `mode:autofix`; candidates are reported under Recommended only, because gate
  surfaces are shared repo infrastructure.
- **`flowctl memory mark-hardened <id> --gate-ref "<path>#<rule-id> -- <note>"`.**
  Sets `status: hardened` and `hardened_into` (stored verbatim - flowctl
  validates non-emptiness only; parsing the convention is skill judgment),
  stamps `last_audited`, and clears the stale-only fields. The entry file is
  never removed, on any track, so "why does this lint rule exist?" stays
  answerable. Idempotent - re-marking replaces `hardened_into`.
- **`memory mark-fresh` is now also the un-graduation path.** It drops
  `hardened_into` along with the stale family, returning a hardened entry to
  `active` so the lesson re-enters the context window. Later audit runs
  gate-liveness-check every hardened entry against the surface named by
  `hardened_into` and propose `mark-fresh` when the gate is gone or inactive.

### Changed

- **`memory` status enum gains `hardened`; default retrieval excludes it.**
  `--status` on `memory list` / `memory search` accepts
  `active|stale|hardened|all`, and the default `active` now excludes **both**
  stale and hardened entries - so `memory-scout` stops surfacing lessons that
  a gate already enforces, with no scout change. Status field invariants are
  exclusive and enforced by every mutation: `mark-stale` drops
  `hardened_into`, `mark-hardened` clears `stale_reason` / `stale_date`, and
  `mark-fresh` drops both families.
- **Cross-version contract documented honestly in `docs/memory-schema.md`.**
  Frontmatter validation runs only on write, so an older flowctl **reads** a
  `hardened` entry silently - and, because its default filter excludes only
  `stale`, will surface it. The loud failure is write-side: any older-flowctl
  rewrite of that entry fails validation on the unknown status and field, so
  there is no silent corruption. Lockstep upgrade of the two flowctl copies is
  the mitigation; no compatibility shim is added or implied.

## [flow-next 3.4.4] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- **Default model routing now leads with Claude Opus 5.** Opus 5 (launched
  2026-07-23: near-Fable intelligence at half the price, same $5/$25 as
  Opus 4.8) replaces Fable 5 as the recommended session/planner tier and
  Opus 4.8 as the native quality-implementation and same-family-heavy-review
  tier. Updated: the setup model-routing scaffold (table row + default
  pipeline), orchestration docs (dated generation note; the 2026-07-14 eval
  rows stay attributed to the models actually measured), and cursor reviewer
  slug lists (`claude-opus-5-thinking-high`, verified live via
  `cursor-agent --list-models`). Fable 5 stays in the table as the
  escalation rung for frontier-hard plans and gates. `agents/*.md` family
  aliases (`opus`) resolve to the new generation automatically - no
  frontmatter changes.
- **Cursor and Copilot review-backend registries gain Claude Opus 5 rungs.**
  Cursor: `claude-opus-5-thinking-high` (verified live via
  `cursor-agent --list-models` 2026-07-24). Copilot: `claude-opus-5` and
  `claude-opus-4.8` per the GitHub supported-models docs - the docs are now
  the recorded source of truth for the copilot ranking, since Copilot model
  availability is org-policy managed and a restricted install rejecting an
  id proves nothing about CLI support. Both registry tops stay GPT
  (`gpt-5.6-sol-high` / `gpt-5.5`) - the cross-family default is deliberate;
  the fallback ladder heals per-org gaps.

## [flow-next 3.4.3] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- **Review caps now count verdicts, not transport flakes (fn-131).** Codex,
  Copilot, Cursor, and RepoPrompt still reserve a round before dispatch, but an
  empty/malformed/no-verdict response, timeout, sandbox denial, or failed
  transport now records an auditable attempt and refunds that reservation.
  Delivered SHIP / NEEDS_WORK / MAJOR_RETHINK verdicts always consume exactly
  one round. Consecutive transport failures have a separate default budget of
  two and stop with `TRANSPORT_UNHEALTHY` + exit 5, never the convergence cap's
  `ESCALATE` + exit 4. `review-rounds record|attempts` exposes the RP finalizer
  and real-versus-refunded history; manual counter resets are no longer needed
  for transport failures.
- **Copy-mode drift detection is now Plan-only (fn-130).** Copy-mode projects still need `/flow-next:setup` after plugin updates, but the duplicated version/snippet ceremony is gone from the lifecycle fleet. When both versions are known and differ, interactive Plan offers a refresh or a one-run continuation; autonomous, Ralph, and receipt-driven Plan invocations warn once and continue. Setup remains the sole owner of setup-mode transitions, snippet integrity, and setup-version stamping. Direct invocation of other skills performs no version preflight.
- **Large skills now load only the branch they execute (fn-130).** Setup, Tracker Sync, Prime, Plan Review, Plan, Work, Strategy, Make PR, and Pilot route mutually exclusive host/provider/backend/optional machinery through one-level references selected by existing state. A frozen `B0 → V1/B1 → candidate` harness kept every behavior and safety contract under zero-loss ratchets; default-path reductions range from 3.17% to 79.21% across the measured clusters. Deterministic source characters remain separate from backend telemetry, and structurally mature non-target skills were explicitly left alone.

### Fixed

- **The reached-path benchmark now reproduces from a fresh checkout on every CI host.** Durable non-release tags retain the frozen B0/B1 source commits, the full test checkout keeps their history available, and harness output/path assertions are CP1252- and Windows-safe.

## [flow-next 3.4.2] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Memory titles starting with `'`, `"`, or `- ` no longer produce invalid YAML frontmatter (#235).** `flowctl memory add` emitted these leading sequences unquoted, writing files its own PyYAML reader rejected; the entry then vanished from `memory list`/`search` with zero diagnostics. The quoting gate now covers leading quotes, block-sequence/mapping-key indicators (`- `, `? `, bare `-`/`?`), and unstripped whitespace; the no-PyYAML inline parser also unescapes double-quoted scalars so both readers round-trip identically. Companion fix: malformed entries are no longer dropped silently - `memory list`/`search` now warn on stderr (`flowctl: skipping <path>: malformed frontmatter`). Thanks to @TechupBusiness for the exceptionally thorough report, down to line numbers and verified breaking sequences.

## [flow-next 3.4.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- **Planning and work now expose prompt-guided parallel waves (fn-118).** `/flow-next:plan` reports execution waves from the task DAG. `/flow-next:work` inspects the complete ready frontier and may dispatch a safe concurrent subset when dependencies, mutable surfaces, host capacity, workspace isolation, and integration are sound; otherwise it explains the constraint and serializes. Parallel workers return task-unique handovers, while the conductor joins and integrates the whole wave before the existing review, completion, tracker, and plan-sync gates. Atomic claims prevent duplicate ownership only — they do not make a shared Git index or filesystem race-safe.

### Fixed

- **Corrected Grok command-discovery guidance.** Live verification on Grok 0.2.111 shows that `/flow-next:` opens the plugin command namespace, including plan/work; `/flow-next-` filters the separate hyphen-named skill surface. The prior “autocomplete under-lists commands” diagnosis conflated those two prefix families. A command-free skill probe also confirmed that Grok renders the skill's `argument-hint` after autocomplete selection.

## [flow-next 3.4.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Grok Build host detection + profile (fn-126).** `/flow-next:setup` detects Grok via positive `GROK_AGENT=1` (probe-verified; `~/.grok` and PATH are not signals), ordered after Droid/Claude/Cursor and before the `else → codex` fallback. Profile: copy mode, `.flow/bin/flowctl`, `/flow-next:` slash syntax (not Codex `$flow-next-`), lifecycle docs default to CLAUDE.md, model-routing scaffold to AGENTS.md (Grok loads both), review menu includes `host` with single-native-family fail-closed (`grok-4.5` only - cross-family via bridges), no Ralph (intentional, same posture as Cursor), no `.codex/agents` copy. Nested Droid→Grok is unsupported if `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` propagates. Docs: `platforms.md` Grok section. No version bump (batched).

## [flow-next 3.3.3] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Capture readiness prompts now follow the spec being authored (fn-128).** Rewriting a draft no longer asks to mark it ready merely because an unrelated spec is ready. Rewriting an already-ready target still asks whether to restore readiness after the rewrite; new captures retain the adopted-repo offer; tracker-authoritative and autofix behavior remain unchanged. The prompt now explains readiness as eligibility for Pilot or another autonomous driver.

## [flow-next 3.3.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Capture no longer rejects a fully visible feature merely because the conversation was compacted earlier (fn-127).** Compaction markers, system-summary blocks, and unrelated truncated tool results are now advisory signals. `/flow-next:capture` proceeds when the evidence needed for the requested spec remains fully visible, while still failing closed without `--from-compacted-ok` when relevant requirements are missing, truncated, summary-only, or depend on unresolved gaps.

## [flow-next 3.3.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Flattened plugin command shims: no more tripled names in the Claude Code slash menu (fn-124).** The command shims moved from the plugin-name-colliding `commands/flow-next/` subdirectory to a flat `commands/*.md` layout, and the pre-plugin-era `name: flow-next:<cmd>` frontmatter was de-prefixed to the bare command name (`name: qa`) so Claude Code's plugin prefix is prepended exactly once. Claude Code now renders `/flow-next:qa` instead of `/flow-next:flow-next:flow-next:qa`, while every command keeps the `name` + `description` frontmatter Cursor's marketplace review checklist requires (fn-123 R11). The Cursor manifest `commands` path, Cursor installers and CI verifier, the Codex prompts installer, CI gates, tests, and smoke fixtures were updated in lockstep. The long-dead `epic-review` alias (slated for removal in 2.0.0) is removed on every platform: the Claude/Cursor shim and the Codex redirect skill are gone, and `install-codex.sh` retires the stale alias from existing installs on upgrade non-destructively (moved to `~/.codex/.flow-next-retired/`, gated on the generator's exact frontmatter id, never deleting a user's own same-named file). A regression test locks the flat layout in place.

### Changed

- **Plugin manifest descriptions aligned to the flow-next.dev messaging register.** The `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` plugin descriptions now read "Zero-dependency, spec-driven agentic SDLC: durable specs, context-fit plans, re-anchored workers, adversarial cross-model review, and receipts." - matching the README hero and the `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` line - and the component counts are corrected to the current 22 subagents / 23 commands / 28 skills.

## [flow-next 3.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Cursor first-class experience (fn-123).** Team-marketplace repo import is the recommended Cursor install (admin imports the GitHub repo via the Cursor GitHub App; Default Off / On / Required modes; auto-refresh on push ~10 min batching); local `install-cursor.sh` / `.ps1` stay as the individual/fallback path. Root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` + plugin-level explicit component paths so marketplace installs never discover `codex/` or `tests/`; ships a `rules/flow-next.mdc` guidance rail (agent-decides scope, never always-apply).
- **`review.backend host` selection sentinel.** Review runs as a fresh-context host-native subagent pinned to a cross-family model via the AGENTS.md model-routing section (bare `host` only; `host:<model>` rejected at write and read time). No subprocess, no new command. On Cursor it uses in-prompt slug pins with tool-enforced read-only; on Claude Code it maps to the native reviewer-subagent arrangement; on Codex it dispatches via `spawn_agent`. Fails closed (interactive ask / autonomous `NEEDS_HUMAN`) when no cross-family pin is available - never a silent same-family self-review. Ralph refuses `host` (no receipt gate). Existing `rp`/`codex`/`copilot`/`cursor`/`none` backends unchanged.

### Changed

- **Read-only agents carry Cursor-native `readonly: true`** - closes the silent write hole where Cursor ignores the `disallowedTools` blacklist. Claude Code and the Codex mirror tolerate the key.
- **Setup is host-aware on Cursor.** Platform detection uses a positive signal (resolved plugin root under `~/.cursor/`) instead of `codex/`-directory absence, so whole-repo marketplace imports classify correctly; the review-backend menu leads with `host`; setup scaffolds the AGENTS.md model-routing section with live Cursor slugs + dispatch-pin rules (cheap scout pin, cross-family review pin, inherit otherwise). `agents/*.md` family aliases degrade to inherit (session model) on Cursor; caller-side pins are the escape hatch (no alias-to-slug rewrite).
- **Print-then-ask read-back contract** for `/flow-next:capture` and `/flow-next:refine`: the full draft prints as ordinary markdown first, then a short approval ask (pointer + tally + options), never a multi-paragraph draft embedded in the question body (which renders as collapsed plain text on every host).
- **Docs truth pass** (platforms.md, README, installers, flow-next.dev): slash autocomplete lists hyphenated commands, natural-language triggering works, AskUserQuestion renders natively including multi-question batches; Cursor has a full agent-hook set but flow-next intentionally does not build/register Ralph there. Admin onboarding runbook added to `platforms.md`.

## [flow-next 3.2.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Complete JSON diagnostics for native spec-ID collisions (FLOW-56).** `flowctl validate --all --json` now includes every counted `fn-N` collision in `root_errors`, matching the actionable text output and preserving exact `total_errors` parity. This fixes behavior present through flow-next 3.2.0; flow-next 3.2.1 is the first fixed version.

## [flow-next 3.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- **Python 3.11+ runtime and faster flowctl startup (fn-122).** Every Unix, Windows, plugin-bin, copied, Ralph, generated, and dogfood launcher now rejects older-but-working interpreters before loading `flowctl.py`. Authenticated static fast paths accelerate `flowctl usage` and root help without executable cache state; help snapshots are scoped to their generating Python minor so other supported runtimes fall back to live argparse without output drift. All other commands compile the tracked source in memory.
- **One task inventory and linear specialized paths (fn-122).** Backlog consumers share canonical task discovery/state projection, reverse dependencies use one adjacency graph, Prime avoids repeated case-folding and Git work, cognitive-aid export materializes one diff, memory reads one buffer per entry, and pilot ticks persist an O(1) counter with recovery. Confirmed dead imports/helpers and test-only production surfaces were removed.
- **Active command contracts repaired (fn-122).** README, plugin docs, agent docs, skills, smoke labels, generated Codex mirror, and flow-next.dev now describe the live post-3.1 command/payload surface. RepoPrompt Community Edition is the primary documented integration; direct exploration uses `rpce-cli`, while Flow-Next wrappers retain discontinued Classic only as the last compatibility fallback. No version bump; release numbering remains batched.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent state and model-cache correctness (fn-122).** Portable cross-process locks now protect task allocation/publication, setup/runtime state, and model-cache mutation on POSIX and Windows. Concurrent task creators cannot acknowledge lost or mismatched JSON/Markdown writes; model cache keys include effective routing intent, preserve unrelated concurrent entries, and never silently downgrade explicit pins. Git/CLI discovery catches non-sticky `OSError` failures.
- **RepoPrompt CE window reuse regression (#228, fn-122).** CE-first discovery follows `rpce-cli` → current CE user link → legacy CE link → Classic `rp-cli`; only discovery failures advance, while selected-CE operational failures remain authoritative. Current `binding.window_id` and `windows[].tabs[].repo_paths` responses now reuse the existing repository window instead of cloning the workspace, with legacy response compatibility retained. CE's Markdown-formatted chat response also retains its session ID through the JSON wrapper. Thanks [@aidancurry](https://github.com/aidancurry) for reporting the regression.

## [flow-next 3.1.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Codex skill catalog un-inverted: prose now resolves the user-facing skills.** Codex injects only skills with `allow_implicit_invocation: true` into the model's skill catalog and defaults ABSENT `openai.yaml` to true - so for months the catalog carried six internal helper skills (`drive`, `sync`, `export-context`, `rp-explorer`, `worktree-kit`, `deps` - which shipped no yaml) while every user verb (`plan`, `work`, `pilot`, `land`, `make-pr`, ...) was hidden with an explicit `false`. Prose like "plan this feature" or "pilot fn-12 to completion" could not resolve the skill and depended on the model rediscovering it from disk. All 22 user-facing skills now ship `true`; the 6 skill-dispatched internals ship an explicit `false` (still invocable by name, out of the shared catalog budget). To keep 22 surfaced entries inside Codex's shared skills context budget (min of 8,000 chars and 2% of the context window, shared with all your other skills), sync-codex now rewrites mirror frontmatter descriptions to dieted catalog lines (2,861 chars total vs ~7.6k undieted; ~2.2k spent today on the accidental internals). Two new validation guards: every mirror skill must declare an explicit catalog policy, and surfaced descriptions must stay <=200 chars.
- **Codex installer now copies template subdirectories (`templates/memory/`).** `install-codex.sh` only copied top-level `*.md` from the mirror's `templates/`, so the memory-track templates (`README.md.tpl`, `bug-track-entry.md.tpl`, `knowledge-track-entry.md.tpl`) never reached `~/.codex/templates/memory/` and flowctl silently fell back to its embedded defaults. The installer now syncs each template subdirectory (rm-then-copy, idempotent), so `_memory_template_path` resolves the shipped templates on Codex installs.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:setup` questions rewritten for people not deep into flow-next.** Every ceremony question now states its stakes in plain language before asking (what a setup mode decides, what a review backend is and that it wants a different model family than the writer, what plan-sync/memory/HTML-artifacts actually do to your repo, what Ralph is) and links flow-next.dev where a longer answer exists (setup modes -> /skills/setup/, review backends -> /review/workflow/, model routing -> /orchestration/, Ralph -> /ralph/overview/). Review-backend option copy now uses role labels ("top reasoning tier", "multi-family menu") instead of stale pinned model ids, per the docs-prose rule. No behavior change - same options, same defaults, same config keys.

## [flow-next 3.1.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **grok bridge recipe upgraded to the editing-delegate form (fn-121 follow-up).** Live probing showed the grok CLI is a full headless editing agent, not a print-only one-shot: `grok --permission-mode acceptEdits -m grok-4.5-high -p "<task>"` edits files in place (same bridge class as `codex exec` / `cursor-agent --force`, on xAI's own quota), and `-p/--single` consumes the NEXT token as the prompt - flags must come first (`grok -p --always-approve "..."` misparses; live-verified failure mode now documented). `templates/usage.md` and the model-routing scaffold's grok route carry the corrected invocation + the `--check` / `--best-of-n` / `--json-schema` extras. Docs-only behavior surface; no version bump (batched).

## [flow-next 3.1.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Plugin mode: zero-rerun setup on Claude Code (fn-121).** `/flow-next:setup` now asks one mode question per repo (Claude Code only). Plugin mode copies NOTHING into the repo - bare `flowctl` rides the plugin's `bin/` PATH injection (new `plugins/flow-next/bin/flowctl` launcher, byte-identical to `scripts/flowctl` modulo the exec target), the agent guide is pulled live via the new `flowctl usage` subcommand, the spec template resolves through the bundled cascade, and the only repo artifact is a slim versioned CLAUDE.md snippet (internal `<!-- flow-next:snippet:v1 -->` sentinel inside the standard markers). Plugin updates land silently - no setup re-runs, ever. Copy mode (all other hosts + mixed-host repos) is byte-unchanged. New `flowctl setup-mode set plugin|copy` is the sole `setup_mode` writer and refuses a plugin stamp unless the CLAUDE.md rail is present and no copy snapshots remain (itemized failures). The fn-95 pre-check went mode-aware across 17 carriers: plugin mode skips the version nag entirely and checks only the snippet contract (consented marker-bounded refresh on drift; autonomy-suppressed; ralph-init exempt). Canonical usage.md moved to `plugins/flow-next/templates/usage.md`; sync-codex strips plugin-mode prose from the mirror (paired transform + guards). Docs: platforms.md setup-modes matrix, orchestration.md "Two layers of steering" (session vs machinery precedence chain), contributor internals in `agent_docs/setup-modes.md`. Supersedes fn-96. No version bump (batched).

## [flow-next 3.0.0] - 2026-07-21

### BREAKING

Three breaking changes, all with documented paths forward:

- **Pre-1.0 migration machinery removed** (fn-111). `migrate-rename` / `migrate-rollback` / `migrate-state` and the auto-detect banner are gone. Port a pre-1.0 `.flow/epics/` repo by hand via the three-sentence prose in `.flow/usage.md` "Pre-1.0 layout porting" (same section in the setup-managed template) and `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
- **Epic/epics alias surface removed** (fn-111). `epic`/`epics` commands, every `--epic*` flag, and the dual-emit JSON keys (`epics`, `epic`, `epic_id`, `epic_count`, ...) are gone; canonical `spec` forms only. The on-disk `depends_on_epics` field is UNCHANGED (canonical schema, not an alias). External consumers reading legacy keys or forwarding `--epic` flags must migrate before upgrading.
- **Ralph users must re-run `/flow-next:ralph-init` after upgrading** (fn-114). Plugin-level hooks no longer exist and `flowctl ralph *` moved to `scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py`; without re-init the guard never fires.

### Changed

- **Model-pin role map in config + setup refresh ceremony (fn-115).** Pins that used to hardcode and rot (triage judge, review defaults, work delegate, sync-codex scout tiers) re-home under one config namespace; the agent owns refresh judgment, flowctl stays mechanical. Dual-copy flowctl mirrored. No version bump (batched).
  - **Role map + resolution (fn-115.1).** `models.roles.<role>.<backend>` for exactly five live roles (`fastJudge` / `review` / `delegate` / `scoutFast` / `scoutIntelligent`) x `codex`/`copilot`/`cursor`, value `model` or `model:effort`, schema-validated on `config set` (unknown role/backend errors with the valid list). Precedence extends fn-76 per consumer: explicit CLI / per-task pin > env > role map > registry baseline. Registry ladders remain availability fallbacks (heal pin-too-new); the role map heals pin-too-old. `fastJudge` re-homes the fn-113.1 `gpt-5.6-luna`@high / `claude-haiku-4.5`@low interim as the baseline under the map. `models.verifiedAt` (ISO) with a 90-day mechanical staleness nudge (one line in status/setup, never blocks; absent = quiet). No probing, no ranking, no LLM in Python.
  - **Setup refresh ceremony (fn-115.2).** `/flow-next:setup` probes installed CLIs (`cursor-agent --list-models`, `copilot -p "/model"`, codex accept-smoke), scans recent review receipts for fallback-ladder activations, the host agent judges all five roles, AskUserQuestion Accept / Stamp-only / Skip, writes pins + `verifiedAt` via `config set`, silent skip under autonomy markers + `mode:autonomous`, optional routing-table update offer. Prose-contract suite pins the contract on canonical + Codex mirror.
  - **Scout-pin consumption + `models resolve` (fn-115.3).** `sync-codex.sh` reads `models.roles.scoutFast|scoutIntelligent.codex` at mirror-regen time when present (env still wins; absent keeps the `gpt-5.4-mini` / `gpt-5.5` baselines). Thin read-only `flowctl models resolve <role> [--backend] [--json]` - pure map + precedence via existing resolvers, the one sanctioned new command this spec adds. Work skill switches the delegate callsite from `config get work.delegateModel` (merged default bypassed the role map) to `models resolve delegate`. Docs: `flowctl.md` config + resolve surface; `orchestration.md` role map as the one place pins rot and setup as the refresh path.
- **Ralph fully opt-in: zero hooks by default, extracted control CLI, guard fixes (fn-114).** Ralph is no longer paid for by every flow-next install. Dual-copy flowctl mirrored where touched. No version bump (batched).
  - **No default install (fn-114.1).** `plugins/flow-next/hooks/hooks.json` deleted; plugin manifest carries no hooks key; fresh installs register zero hooks. Registration is agent-driven ralph-init prose (merge into project settings per platform, idempotent fingerprinted entries, trust-prompt consent; Claude/Droid/Codex-subset, Cursor scaffold-only). Setup asks default-No with guard-entry removal path; uninstall parity; cursor installers stop copying hooks. Pinned by `test_no_default_hooks`.
  - **Surface extraction (fn-114.2).** `flowctl ralph pause/resume/stop/status` and progress parsing move into the ralph-init template `scripts/ralph/ralphctl.py`. `flowctl status` soft-probes `scripts/ralph/runs/` only when present (absent = zero cost; JSON always carries `runs`). Codex mirror + install no longer ship/generate `hooks.json` (zero-default complete); install still sets `[features] hooks = true` so a later ralph-init project hooks file can load. TUI unaffected (reads runs dir directly). `stamp_ralph_iteration` already deduped (fn-112).
  - **Six guard fixes (fn-114.3).** Structured done-detection (exit code / `--json` status / exact completion line; word sniff gone); dual-platform matchers (`Bash|Execute` + `Edit|Write|Create|ApplyPatch`, host-appropriate registration); file-tool receipt-path writes blocked pre-review (Bash parity); `RALPH_GUARD_DEBUG=1`-gated log + `tempfile.gettempdir()`; `RALPH_GUARD_VERSION` deleted + local-dev wires `ralph_e2e_test.sh`; key=value progress contract (ralphctl parse + ralph.sh writer + soft-probe parity).
  - **Docs truth-up (fn-114.4).** `ralph.md` / `platforms.md` / `flowctl.md` / `sync-codex.md` / CLAUDE.md checklist describe the shipped state (opt-in install, ralphctl control surface, soft-probe, guard rules, Codex zero-default + retained `[features] hooks=true`).
  - **Upgrade note (loud):** Existing Ralph users must re-run `/flow-next:ralph-init` after upgrade so project hooks re-register (plugin-level hooks are gone) and `ralphctl.py` lands under `scripts/ralph/`. Without re-init, the guard will not fire and `flowctl ralph *` no longer exists.
- **flowctl judgment evictions (fn-113).** Judgment moves back to the host skill on the surfaces the fn-101 audit flagged; autonomous receipt consumers stay deterministic. Dual-copy flowctl mirrored. No version bump (batched).
  - **Triage-judge codex default + CLAUDE.md carve-out (fn-113.1).** Codex triage-skip judge default moves `gpt-5-mini` @low → `gpt-5.6-luna` @high (probe-verified; copilot `claude-haiku-4.5` @low unchanged; `--model`/`--effort` overrides stay). CLAUDE.md "How to spot a mistake" names the sanctioned subprocess-LLM judgment cases (review-backend dispatch, triage-skip judge, fn-55 delegation classify) so future audits do not re-flag them. Interim until fn-115 re-homes as `fastJudge`.
  - **Memory-add overlap: caller decides (fn-113.2).** `flowctl memory add` no longer auto-updates on high token/tag overlap. Always creates unless the caller passes explicit `--update <id>` (same merge semantics as the old auto-branch). Overlap scoring still runs; JSON always emits `matches` (with scores) as a retrieval signal. Moderate overlap may still set `related_to` on a new entry. Callers reworded (worker, qa, make-pr, memory-migrate) + docs.
  - **Scope suggest evicted (fn-113.3).** The `scope suggest` subcommand is gone (~53 LOC of `1 <= n < 3` threshold math). The fire rule lives in capture skill prose (R25: 1-2 distinct R24 signal categories), pinned by `TestR25ThresholdProseContract`. `scope resolve` / `bank` / `write-policy` untouched.
  - **Deep-pass/validator split-by-mode (fn-113.4).** Autonomy markers (`FLOW_RALPH=1`, `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` set, `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1`) keep the schema-checked deterministic path: verdict-flip thresholds, fingerprint confidence promotion, validator receipt mutation (receipts byte-identical to pre-change fixtures). Interactive impl-review surfaces raw findings (`host_judges: true`) and does not run flowctl merge/promotion math or mutate the receipt; the host judges.
- **Review backend registry driver + fenced-JSON tallies (fn-112).** The nine `codex`/`copilot`/`cursor` × `impl`/`plan`/`completion` review commands collapse onto one `cmd_backend_review` driver; per-backend variance lives as `BACKEND_REGISTRY` hooks (sandbox, session marker, argv budget). Review prompts move to skill `references/*-prompt.md` templates with byte-identical embedded FALLBACKs. Reviewer tallies prefer one fenced `json` block (`suppressed_count`, `classification_counts`, `unaddressed`, `deep_findings`); prose-regex parsers remain a logged fallback. The `<verdict>` tag contract is unchanged. Plan/completion handlers self-write review status. Dual-copy flowctl mirrored. No version bump (batched).

### Fixed

- **fn-111/fn-119 follow-ups (PR-review findings).** The parallel runner fails loudly on files where unittest discovers zero tests (rc-0 no-op guard); `test_codex_hooks_normalize.py` converted from pytest-style module functions to unittest (its 10 tests had silently never run in CI); the bundled TUI migrated off the removed epic aliases (`specs --json`, `--spec` flags, boundary mapping of the canonical `spec` wire key).

### Removed

- **flowctl dead-surface sweep (fn-111).** ~2.7k LOC of zero-caller CLI surface removed across three cuts, plus docs drift corrected. Dual-copy flowctl mirrored. No version bump (batched).
  - **Pre-1.0 migration machinery (breaking).** `migrate-rename` / `migrate-rollback` / `migrate-state`, the auto-detect banner hook, and `/flow-next:setup` Step 1b are gone. Port a pre-1.0 `.flow/epics/` repo by hand via the three-sentence prose in `.flow/usage.md` "Pre-1.0 layout porting" (same section in the setup-managed template) and the one-liner in `docs/troubleshooting.md`. Orphaned tests deleted (`test_migrate_rename.py`, `test_banner.py`, `test_lockfile.py`, `migration_smoke.sh` + CI step). Capture/make-pr no longer scan legacy `epics/`.
  - **Epic/epics aliases + dual-emit JSON keys (breaking for flow-swarm).** `epic`/`epics` commands, `--epic*` flags, R31 dual-emit keys (`epics` alongside `specs`, `epic` alongside `spec`, `epic_count`, `epic_blocked_by`, `legacy_reason`), the deprecation helper, and the empty config-alias triple-parse path are gone (empty-map seam kept). Canonical `depends_on_epics` field untouched. **flow-swarm currently reads the `epics` JSON key and forwards `--epic` flags** (`src/lib/flowctl.ts`) and must migrate off those before consuming this cut; maintainer-owned.
  - **Dead command surfaces.** `rp windows`/`pick-window`/`ensure-workspace`/`builder`, `prep-chat`, `memory discoverability-patch`, `task show-backend`/`set-deps` (shared `_resolve_same_spec_deps` helper extracted for survivors), `sync clear-dep-relation`, `strategy list`, `repo-map show`/`since-ref`, `prospect list`/`read`, `checkpoint delete`, `state-path`, `pilot-log summary`, backend `check` triplet (codex/copilot/cursor), always-empty `review_receipts` export field, and the dead `--section` export filter.
  - **Docs drift (fn-101 §6).** `flowctl.md` / `architecture.md` / `ralph.md` brought in line with the live CLI: `setup-block` / `scope` / `strategy` / `spec skeleton` / `codex classify-result`+`rollback-plan` / `rp setup-review`+`chat-send` / `done` inline `--summary`/`--evidence` documented; `pilot-log append` + `review-rounds` listed in Available Commands; File Structure + `.flow/` layout completed; Ralph run control documented as `PAUSE`/`STOP` sentinels + `progress.txt` (not `state.json`); removed commands scrubbed from `docs/`.

## [flow-next 2.22.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- **Test-suite speed: file-level parallel shard runner (fn-119).** New stdlib entrypoint `scripts/run_tests_parallel.py` discovers top-level `test_*.py` files and runs them concurrently (default jobs = cores-2; `--serial` for the serial fallback; `--shuffle` for the ordering canary; per-file hard timeout `--file-timeout`, default 900s - a hung file fails loudly as rc=124 instead of stalling the suite; repeatable `--exclude`, every exclusion printed). Windows CI runs 81/87 files (was 29/87 pre-fn-119): 6 latent windows incompatibilities surfaced by the first full-corpus run are excluded with per-file causes and tracked in fn-120. CI matrix unit tests use this entrypoint; `workflow_dispatch` exposes a manual shuffle canary (no new scheduled workflow). `worker.md` names it as the canonical full-suite command. `smoke_test.sh` untouched. Repo-local scoped-verification convention (CLAUDE.md / `.flow/templates/spec.md` / `.flow/usage.md`): per-task Quick commands are focused suites; the parallel full suite runs once at the final gate. Slow-file diet on `test_prime_eval` + `test_gate_receipt` (template copytree / setUpClass / in-process gate dispatch; same test counts). Stale-test sweep deferred known candidates to fn-111's fallout list (zero overlap deletions). No version bump (batched).

## [flow-next 2.21.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- **flowctl config snapshots and one-call task creation (fn-110).**
  - **Snapshot-based `config get`.** Three read forms backed by one command-scoped snapshot: keyed scalar (byte-identical to 2.20.0), keyed subtree (`config get land --json` returns the merged namespace dict), and keyless root (`config get --json` returns the whole merged config). `--raw` parity on all three (set-only values, absent leaves omitted); subtree/root output emits canonical key names.
  - **Create-time task completeness.** `task create` gains `--description-file` (same normalization as `task set-spec`) and `--satisfies R1,R3` (strict R-ID grammar `R[1-9][0-9]*[a-z]?`, duplicates rejected, order preserved, validation before any write), so a freshly planned task is complete in one call.
  - **Skill callsites consume the snapshot forms.** land captures its configuration as one subtree read; plan takes one root snapshot and creates each task in a single call; pilot's configuration read is owned by SKILL.md and shared across its split files; make-pr consolidates its Phase 0 reads; impl-review parses arguments in one fence; plan-review's per-backend blocks are single-sourced (Foreground rule and the fn-90 deterministic-cap sentence byte-preserved). `test_skill_prose_diet.py` pins every invariant on canonical files and the codex mirror.
  - **Foreground rule embedded in review and gate-suite fences.** Review-command and gate-suite fences carry the rule inline where the invocation happens (fn-78 stall-class hardening).
  - Dual-copy flowctl mirrored.

## [flow-next 2.20.0] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Gate-diet receipt follow-up (fn-116).** The green-receipt path introduced in 2.18.0 was structurally dead after the work loop committed its `.flow` state: exact-HEAD lookup orphaned an otherwise valid receipt. `gate check` now permits a bounded, fail-closed ancestor walk through receipt-only state changes; it does not loosen the force-full floor or promise the separate parallelization work.

## [flow-next 2.19.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **flowctl hot-path perf: memoized repo-root/state-dir lookups (fn-109).** `flowctl list --json` on a 100-spec / 403-task repo dropped from 30.8s to under 1s (`status` 32s to under 1.5s): `load_task_with_state` was spawning 2 uncached `git rev-parse` subprocesses PER TASK - 809 spawns per list. pilot/land/ralph run these reads every tick, so this is loop-tick latency across the whole autonomy track.
  - **cwd-keyed, success-only memoization.** `get_repo_root()` / `get_state_dir()` cache per `Path.cwd()` (state-dir additionally keyed by the `FLOW_STATE_DIR` env value), so a chdir invalidates naturally and the module-scope-load + per-test chdir suites keep passing. Only SUCCESS results are cached - the CalledProcessError fallbacks stay uncached, so a transient git failure is never sticky. Regression test asserts `cmd_list` at 400+ tasks spawns <= 5 subprocesses.
  - **Cache sweep on the smaller repeat offenders.** `get_copilot_version` / `get_cursor_version` gain a per-process memo keyed by the `shutil.which()`-resolved executable path (success-only; PATH change re-probes; the disk model cache is untouched); prospect enumeration reads + frontmatter-parses each artifact exactly once per pass (was 3) and `_prospect_resolve_id` resolves an exact filename hit without enumerating the directory; `cmd_tasks`'s double `get_flow_dir()` is absorbed by the repo-root cache.
  - **Batched export git grep.** `_export_removed_export_refs` issues one `git grep -n -w -F -e s1 -e s2 ...` per 20-symbol chunk (at most 2 spawns for the 40-symbol cap, was up to 40), with per-symbol attribution recovered by a Python post-filter replicating `-w` word-boundary semantics exactly - payload byte-identical to the sequential form (oracle-tested).
  - No behavior change anywhere; dual-copy flowctl mirrored. Released as 2.19.1.

## [flow-next 2.19.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Delegation diet: path-handoff replaces the composed brief (fn-103).** The raw `codex exec` bridge is documented as the interactive route; `delegate:codex` is the same bridge with deterministic rails for unattended loops. Task and spec files carry the implementation contract, and the plan task template now requires named files, named test cases, and named acceptance because downstream executors receive the task file as their brief. The delegation reference index now describes one run per task. No version bump (batched release).

## [flow-next 2.18.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Work-loop gate diet: green receipts + docs-only gate tiering + event-driven waits (fn-102).** Trace-mining the fn-89 run showed about 50% of a 2h41 work stage spent re-running the full unittest suite ten times on already-proven trees; the fix is mechanical, never semantic.
  - **New `flowctl gate` group.** `gate receipt` / `gate check` record command-fingerprinted green receipts at `.flow/tmp/green-receipts/`, honored only for exact HEAD, exact command, clean worktree, and a 24h TTL, then fail closed to running the full gate. `gate classify` selects docs-only tier-B through ordered path precedence reusing triage-skip primitives; mirror, skill, and agent prose plus all code extensions force FULL.
  - **Worker and host wiring.** Baseline check honors receipts; Verify-before-completing classifies, runs full or tier-B, and writes receipts after passing full gates. Host Phase 4 uses a persisted spec-run base. Every skip is loud: `GATE_SKIPPED:` lines in task-evidence `tests[]` and per-outcome `Gates:` lines in the Phase 5 summary.
  - **Delegation polling.** The codex-delegation poll loop changes from 10s to 2s intervals, with the same 60s bound.
  - **Scope guard.** Predicates are commit-hash equality, cleanliness, receipt age, and path membership only; fn-83's semantic-skip ban stands and its decision record gains a forward pointer. Review triage-skip protects meaning while the gate tier protects executables: two whitelists with two purposes.
  - **Boundaries and generated surfaces.** Remote CI is out of scope; worktree-mode receipts are per checkout. Dual-copy flowctl and the Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 2.17.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Tracker-sync lifecycle dispatches off the critical path (fn-89).** Comment-shaped tracker touchpoints on LINKED specs, on Claude Code, now dispatch to a background `tracker-runner` subagent (sonnet) so the host keeps working - fire-and-forget where a later in-session `sync check` audits the receipt (`work.done`, comment-leaf completion review), awaited before the skill summary where none does (`resolve-pr`, `qa`). The runner executes the existing flow-next-tracker-sync skill body for the one op, with no second implementation, and reports the parseable terminal line `TRACKER_RUNNER=<status> spec=<id> note="..."` parsed from the LAST line of output.
  - The shared discipline reference `plugins/flow-next/references/tracker-dispatch.md` is the sole statement of the rules: five-sentence discipline, both MUST invariants (single state-writer per spec and join-before-audit), join mechanics, host capability ladder, and recovery. Every touchpoint gate carries one conditional sentence pointing at it.
  - Pre-audit joins: the three `sync check` call sites (work Phase 5, make-pr, capture) each await outstanding dispatches for the audited spec first, closing the demonstrated false-MISSING duplicate-retro-fire race. Resolve-pr and qa dispatch lines now carry their `event:` tags so `sync check` can audit those events.
  - Host capability ladder: Claude Code Tier A (background plus notification join, `TaskOutput(block=true)` forbidden); Cursor and Codex Tier B (isolated-but-awaited, Codex probe-verified 2026-07-18 on codex-cli 0.144.1); Tier C inline degrade, loudly never silently. Everything else stays inline byte-identical: state-shaped ops (`reconcile`/`push`/`create-if-unlinked`), unlinked first touches, ceremonies, manual runs, `--dry-run`, interactive conflict resolution, `land.merged`. Forked genuine conflicts queue via `sync defer`, never prompt.
  - No flowctl changes, no new config leaves; receipts, event tags, and `sync check` semantics untouched. `forked => queue-not-ask` folded into tracker-sync's single RALPH gate. Codex mirror regenerated (tracker-runner toml plus role rewrite guard).
  - Hardening from the live proof + PR #212 review waves: comments-sync retry rule (a post whose response fails to parse may have landed - re-check the dedup marker before ANY re-post; found live as a runner triple-post), `lastSyncedAt` advance scoped to two-way reconciles so comment appends are provably state-free (makes the overlap invariant sound), tier-conditional dispatch wording (Tier A fire-and-forget, Tier B awaited) with a tier-based gate readable as-is in the mirror, runner terminal outcomes surfaced in host summary contracts (`Tracker runner:` lines - an `errored`/`queued` outcome is visible nowhere else), Codex-mirror `tracker_runner` role rewrite + hard-fail guard, and platform-matrix tier notes for Codex + Cursor in `docs/platforms.md`.

## [flow-next 2.16.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Interview asks in frontier rounds (fn-100).** `/flow-next:refine` replaces the one-`AskUserQuestion`-call-per-turn depth-first walk with frontier rounds: each round asks the whole frontier - every question whose prerequisites are already settled - split across `AskUserQuestion` calls of up to 4 questions grouped by topic and announced as one round. A question is never asked alongside its own prerequisite (dependents defer to a later round); the frontier is recomputed once per round instead of once per call, pruned branches are announced at the next round's opener, and branch depth caps at 4 rounds. Eval-validated on the canonical `optimization/interview/` harness (fn-84.3 protocol, blind fable E4/E5 judges): accuracy floor 12/12 on every rep of both arms, quality 7/8 under the shipped wording (thin-fixture E4 0/2 -> 3/3 vs baseline), zero intra-round dependency violations across all 11 partition-scored rounds runs; full data in `optimization/interview/{results.tsv,changelog.md}`.
  - **"A frontier slot is earned."** NFR probes (failure modes, concurrency, scale, portability, testing) always qualify however thin the spec; pure-cosmetic polish folds into a related question's options or a stated write-back default - the scoped rule that fixed the first-pass padding regression on the thin fixture.
  - **Doc-aware budgets are per round, not per call.** The glossary/decision/strategy meta-question throttles in `references/doc-aware.md` count once per round (they do not multiply across the calls within a round); the two fuzzy-term sharpening triggers are observation-based (user replies) so they stay reachable in a 3-5 round interview. `docs/teams.md` and `docs/strategy.md` updated to the per-round wording.
  - **R-IDs glossed at first mention.** A question citing a spec R-ID attaches a short plain-words gist - "R3 (the audit line's required fields)" - never a bare "R3" the interviewee must open the spec to decode, and never the full criterion text (question-body bloat).
  - **Async fact-scouts (optional, rounds mode).** While the user answers the current round, the interviewer MAY dispatch ONE read-only fact-scout subagent to resolve the codebase lookups gating next-round questions - investigation latency hides inside user-answer time. The brief is the contract (numbered lookups, each naming the question it gates; no brief, no deferral), scout tier is sonnet-minimum with escalation (eval-validated: the fastest tier missed a load-bearing storage-architecture fact the mid tier found on the identical brief), load-bearing digest facts are spot-verified before `[high]` recommendations, and an unavailable scout degrades loudly to inline investigation. No total-token savings claimed - the wins are latency-hiding and interviewer context-growth halving; eval addendum in `optimization/interview/changelog.md`.
  - Standalone checkpoint questions (scope selection, code-mismatch, write-back consent, mark-ready) stay outside the rounds protocol. Codex mirror regenerated (idempotent, plain-text ask-block audit clean). Ordering/batching change only - the plain-language question contract is otherwise unchanged (the R-ID-gloss bullet above is its one additive extension), and confidence tiers, skipped-questions contract, scope passes, write-back, and tracker sync are untouched. No flowctl changes.

## [flow-next 2.15.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **Setup-block diet: evidence schema inline, minimal always-loaded block, usage.md trim (fn-99).** A clean-room guidance eval (2026-07-15, 18 runs) found the one thing the always-loaded docs measurably buy is the **evidence-JSON schema**: the old 575-token "## Flow-Next" block named `--evidence-json e.json` but never showed the shape, so capable agents reliably called `done` without valid evidence - the only failure mode measured anywhere. Everything here is eval-gated (zero-quality-loss standard, fn-82/fn-85 conventions).
  - **Always-loaded block: 575 -> 249 tokens-equivalent (chars/4), WITH the inline evidence schema.** The setup-written `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` block now carries `# e.json: {"commits": ["<sha>"], "tests": ["<command>"], "prs": []}` plus a one-line claim -> implement -> commit flow; retains the flowctl-only + no-TodoWrite rules, quick command shape, spec-creation cascade, re-anchor rule, and the usage.md pointer. A baseline round caught that placeholder style matters: `["abc123"]`-style placeholders still produced schema-shaped but EMPTY evidence lists on weak tiers; the `["<sha>"]` phrasing measurably closed most of it. Post-trim gate (2026-07-16, same 28-run matrix): minimal arm 14/14 unchanged (haiku floor intact), amended full block 12/14 vs the 9/14 baseline - no cell regressed, sonnet multitask went 1/3 -> 3/3, haiku slugify 0/3 -> 1/3 with the residual a strictly-softer task-granularity artifact (intermediate micro-tasks done with empty evidence while the final commit task records the real sha). Full rows in the harness README ledger.
  - **`usage.md` template: 5392 -> 1928 tokens-equivalent.** Cut File Structure, the `--help`-duplicating Common Commands bulk (a 10-line typical-flow core stays), and the Deprecation section; kept CLI, IDs, Orchestration & model steering (verbatim - the only section external pointers target, per the consumer audit), Workflow, Evidence JSON, Parallel Worktrees, More Info. Landed 3-way atomically (template + `.flow/usage.md` dogfood + codex mirror; parity + slash-token CI guards green). Loading-contract wording corrected where stated (repo + docs-site): usage.md is read **on demand** - the always-loaded block points agents at it - not "every session". Usage-included gate (2026-07-16, 28-run matrix + 6-run extension on the differing cell): trimmed vs pre-trim usage.md with the same block - every dimension identical across arms except one haiku cell whose failure mode occurs in BOTH arms (not content-attributable; all evidence-teaching lines survived the trim verbatim); no regression attributable to the trim.
  - **Pristine-upgrade detection (new `flowctl setup-block` helper).** Setup records a per-target sha256 of the written block in `.flow/meta.json` `setup.block_hashes` (`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` hash independently); re-runs silently refresh hash-matching (uncustomized) blocks and ask Keep/Overwrite only for genuinely customized ones; hash-absent legacy installs get at most one ask ever (a `"customized"` sentinel records a Keep). Without this, every existing repo would have hit the Keep/Overwrite prompt on this very block change and decliners would never receive the evidence-schema fix.
  - **Guards that stay in CI:** a lockstep parity test pins the two snippet twins identical modulo the documented `/flow-next:` vs `$flow-next-` syntax substitutions; token-budget tripwires assert block <= 300 / usage.md template <= 2800 tokens-equivalent (budgets sit above targets; regrowth trips the test, content changes re-run the eval).
  - **Guidance-eval harness committed** under `agent_docs/guidance-eval/` (runner + per-cell scaffold + deterministic grader + README with grading contract, threat model, and results ledger). Clean-room mechanism probe-verified for OAuth logins: default config dir + `claude -p --setting-sources project,local` (`--bare` is API-key-only; a fresh `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` drops the login); `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access --skip-git-repo-check` for the Codex arm. Maintainer dev tool: committed + documented, deliberately not CI-wired.
  - **Sandbox-blocked-commit guidance** added where autonomous agents actually read: `agents/worker.md` near its evidence teaching (primary) and usage.md's Workflow section.
  - No flowctl behavior/validation changes beyond the additive `setup-block` helper; the model-routing scaffold block is untouched. Released as 2.19.1.

## [flow-next 2.14.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **Multi-model orchestration defaults: delegate model steering, setup pipeline scaffold, recipe hardening (fn-97).** A controlled multi-model pipeline eval (2026-07-14: hidden 39-check oracle suite for the work stage, planted-bug review eval at n=3 reps per arm with matched reasoning efforts, dual cross-family blind plan judges) validated the orchestration shape flow-next ships and exposed four small gaps. One task's evidence - cited as motivation, never as a guarantee.
  - **`work.delegateModel` default flips `gpt-5.6-sol` -> `gpt-5.6-terra`** (`work.delegateEffort` stays `medium`): terra-medium matched sol on hidden-suite correctness at ~2/3 the wall-clock on frontier-authored specs, with effort above medium pure overhead. The bridge already passes both keys explicitly (`-m` / `-c model_reasoning_effort=`); set `work.delegateModel gpt-5.6-sol` to escalate for gnarly tasks. NOTE: the flip reaches new installs and unset keys only - `flowctl init` persists defaults into `.flow/config.json` (raw values win on upgrade), so pre-existing installs keep whatever was persisted; flip manually with `flowctl config set work.delegateModel gpt-5.6-terra`. Docs updated across `flowctl.md`, `orchestration.md`, `codex-delegation.md`, `phases.md`, the model-routing snippet, and the usage.md template (which now names both steering keys).
  - **Setup: bridge-gated multi-model pipeline scaffold.** The Model Routing question now fires only when at least one bridge CLI (`codex` / `cursor-agent` / `grok`) is detected on PATH (`BRIDGE_DETECTED`) - with zero bridges every wiring route would be an inert install-note comment. Question copy reframed as the recommended multi-model pipeline; the snippet now states the recommended default pipeline concretely (session model authors specs - capture/interview/plan - then terra implements, then a cross-family reviewer; resolves to fable->terra->sol on Claude Code, sol->terra->Claude-family-or-sol on Codex) and gains a wrapper-pattern pointer for autonomous loops; the cursor review route now recommends current strongest models (`cursor:claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high`, fable-5-thinking as the frontier gate - NO ZDR - or `cursor:gpt-5.6-sol-high` to reach sol without a codex CLI) with composer/grok demoted to quick extra voices; the Review question labels Codex `(Recommended - cross-family default)` when detected on a Claude-family writer host (on GPT-writer hosts the label and switch offer are skipped - same family), and scaffolding adds an explicit non-destructive switch offer to `review.backend codex` when a different backend is already configured (decline keeps everything as-is). Still interactive-only (never fires under any autonomy marker) and still never silently overwrites existing config.
  - **Codex mirror worker pin, opt-in.** `sync-codex.sh` gains `CODEX_MODEL_WORKER` / `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT_WORKER` sync-time knobs for pinning the mirror worker role (recommended: `gpt-5.6-terra` @ `medium`, eval-motivated). Default is UNSET: the worker keeps `inherit` - the Codex session model rules, exactly like the Claude-side worker. flow-next does not hardcode model opinions into generated config; the recommendation lives in the routing scaffold prose. FAST/INTELLIGENT mapping for every other agent unchanged.
  - **usage.md bridge-recipe hardening (strictly safer).** All `codex exec` recipe lines carry `--skip-git-repo-check` (outside a trusted git repo codex refuses in ~1s with the error only in the log - a fire-and-forget caller sees a clean silent failure); the write-mode recipe asserts the intended workspace first (the flag also disables codex's git-repo preflight, so the guard keeps it a silence fix, never a safety bypass); the `cursor-agent` recipe warns to run inside a git repo (in a non-repo dir it blocks on an interactive trust prompt and exits "successfully" with empty output). Existing projects pick both up on the next `/flow-next:setup` re-run.
  - **Codex self-bridge documented + MAv2 steering caveat.** On GPT-5.6-Sol/Multi-Agent-V2 builds, per-spawn model steering is currently unreliable (openai/codex#31814/#32782/#33268/#33314); orchestration.md, platforms.md, and the usage.md bridge recipes now document the robust route from a Codex host - the same-family `codex exec -m` self-bridge (flat child prompt; nested MAv2 subagents can return undecodable results, #33267). Re-check tracked as a stub spec.
  - **`orchestration.md`: "A proven default pipeline".** Model-per-role defaults table with a per-host reach column (roles are host-independent because the bridges run both directions; only the reach mechanism differs) - plan session-native by design, work terra-medium, impl-review sol-high cross-family first pass + session-model final gate; luna-xhigh as the equal-recall-slower alternative; grok-4.5 as classic-bug quick pass only, never the gate. Plus the wrapper-pattern subsection (thin fast-tier wrapper for unattended loops; bridge runs in the FOREGROUND; self-heal license covers environment/flags only, never judgment) and the raw-bridge severity-tier note (ad-hoc review prompts should demand P0-P3 tiers + spec-grounded verdicts; the packaged impl-review find-vs-fix split is deliberately unchanged). Single-subscription framing throughout: multi-model routing is optional garnish, every row degrades to the session model.
  - No behavior change when the new defaults are untouched and the setup question is declined, except the strictly-safer recipe flags and the delegate-default flip documented above. Released as 2.19.1.

## [flow-next 2.13.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Prime classify: tier-(c) constellation ASK noise on ordinary repos** (found dogfooding 2.13.0 on real repos, shipped directly as a patch). The prose cross-repo-ref scan now (1) drops SELF-references - a README mentioning the repo's own absolute path (`~/work/<this-repo>/src`) is not a cross-repo signal (realpath-resolved against the assessed root), (2) dedupes repeated refs (four mentions of the same script burned the 20-ref cap), and (3) ignores well-known user DATA dirs that never hold sibling repos (`~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Library`, `~/.cache`, `~/.config`, `~/.local`, `/tmp`). On a real affected repo the ref list dropped from 20 (capped, noisy) to 8 genuinely cross-repo entries; repos whose only "constellation signal" was self/data-path noise no longer raise the Phase 0.6 clarification or pollute `--classify-only` portfolio triage. Dogfood also confirmed the 2.13.0 envelope truthfulness live (an over-cap file correctly marked a real repo's size collector truncated) and sub-2s classify on 1K-file repos.

## [flow-next 2.13.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **Opinionated, structure-aware `/flow-next:prime` (fn-92).** At portfolio scale the old existence-checks lie: a repo could pass prime's criteria (a CLAUDE.md exists, a hook file exists, a `lint` script exists) yet be un-agentic in practice (empty template, broken build, unresolved imports, or really one of 99 sibling repos), and there was no way to hand-verify hundreds of repos across 10-11 stacks. Prime is rebuilt to **classify what kind of project this is, judge substance not existence, and lead with a verdict + ranked next-actions instead of a maturity level.** No new mode and no flag toggling the old behavior back on (that would preserve the failure mode this retires); the 8-pillar scan stays as the evidence layer underneath, and existing args (`--report-only`, `--fix-all`, repo-root path) keep their semantics. The one new arg is `--classify-only`.
  - **Phase 0.5 classification** - a five-axis project profile (lifecycle, topology as two independent bits monorepo/constellation-member, size/legibility band, stack(s), delivery shape(s)) plus an orthogonal `assessment_scope` (`repository | workspace-member | constellation-home-base`). It parameterizes everything downstream: scout dispatch hints, N/A denominators, report shape, and playbook selection.
  - **Operability ladder + hard gates** - Phase 2 now judges whether an agent can actually *operate* the repo from executed evidence: tier 1 (build runs) / tier 2 (tests discoverable and run) / tier 3 (app boots to a ready signal), per-surface with a min-deployable headline and per-member tiers on monorepos. Three hard gates - **G1** (build actually runs), **G2** (tests discoverable when a framework is claimed), **G3** (agent-file quoted commands resolve/execute) - are named in the headline and cap the maturity level at 2 when failing. The maturity level is demoted to secondary metadata below the scores table.
  - **New agent-readiness groups** - agent observability & drivability (AO/DR), a tooling/operability group (TO), and a harness & permissions group (HP) synthesized host-inline in Phase 3, feeding the verdict; the enable-QA recommendation fires only at operability tier 3 with all four DR-core passing.
  - **Per-shape playbooks + per-stack matrix** - five delivery-shape playbooks (greenfield / standard / monorepo / huge-legacy / constellation, plus a light variant), a tiered ranked-actions catalog, the LEG1-LEG9 legibility patterns, and a 15+-row per-stack matrix where **adding a stack is a data row, never a skill-logic edit**; an unknown stack degrades to the generic operability ladder with an honest "no per-stack playbook yet" line.
  - **New deterministic flowctl surface - `flowctl prime classify [root] --json`** (the ONLY flowctl addition): a pure-stdlib, bounded, no-LLM emitter for Phase 0.5's raw signals (axes 1-4 values + mechanical confidence, raw Axis-5 shape markers, per-collector completeness diagnostics). All judgment (shape reasoning, final confidence, clarification asks, playbook selection) stays in the skill. Dual-copy byte-identical across `plugins/flow-next/scripts/flowctl.py` and `.flow/bin/flowctl.py` (parity-tested), with a **redaction contract** (evidence carries key names only, never secret values or complete sensitive config lines; fixture-asserted) and per-collector budgets that keep it under ~10s on a multi-M-LOC repo.
  - **`--classify-only`** - wraps the emitter plus the judgment layer, prints the classification block and exits in seconds; the portfolio-triage entry point for 100+ repos. Never asks (prints confidence + a would-ask list instead of the Phase 0.6 clarification).
  - **Two-oracle eval split** - a CI oracle tests the EMITTER only (raw signals, markers, exclusions on synthetic fixtures, 3-OS deterministic, wired into `.github/workflows/test-flow-next.yml`); a non-CI agentic harness under `optimization/prime/` (defined runner, model/version provenance, pass rubric, blocking threshold) evaluates the final five-axis judgment. Prose-contract tests pin skill wording but never claim to prove judgment.
  - **Supporting rewrites** - `pillars.md` (substance pass-conditions, new group tables, single N/A whitelist, and a criterion-to-score map carrying a probe-owner column: emitter / host-inline / scout); four new reference files under the skill (`classification.md`, `playbooks.md`, `stacks.md`, `harness.md`) plus `remediation.md` for the new artifacts (orientation map, home-base kit, encoding guard, compile wrapper, deny-rules baseline, run-and-observe recipe); `claude-md-scout` gains a DC2 substance rubric + stack-row dispatch context. Codex mirror regenerated.
  - **Vocabulary** - `GLOSSARY.md` gains **Operability ladder**, **Hard gate**, **Delivery shape**, and **Classification (prime)** as public terms.
  - **Pending downstream (flow-next.dev, deferred to the maintainer's release walk per amended R14):** a public prime docs-site page reflecting the verdict/classification framing, plus its entries in **both** navigation sources (the `DocsRail.astro`/`site.ts` left rail AND the `astro.config.mjs` Starlight sidebar), and a docs-site changelog entry. In-repo docs keep `skills.md` (+ the SKILL.md and its four references) as the canonical surface; there is deliberately **no** `plugins/flow-next/docs/prime.md` page.
  - **Post-plan hardening via PR review (29 bot-review waves on PR #207)** - the emitter absorbed a long adversarial review cycle: envelope truthfulness (capped reads/scans mark truncated, sampled LOC never ranks stacks), CI-gate honesty (`gated_test_step`/`gated_lint_step` per-workflow conjunction, executable-content-only matching, installer/echo/comment segments excluded, gitlab/bitbucket/azure/CircleCI trigger semantics, default-write formatters count as mutating), security hardening (metacharacter-rejection/argv-only rule in §2.6 pinned by prose-contract tests, build probe captures its own exit status, hook `matched_tokens` whitelist, root-containment + symlink guards on all tracked reads, eval-harness isolation breaches incl. projection tamper/stderr leaks/deleted sentinels), and classification fixes (single-squash source imports are brownfield, lockfile is a corroborator only, workspace-member re-rooting, gitdir-pointer resolution, LOC-weighted stack shares). 187 emitter tests in the CI oracle.

## [flow-next 2.12.4] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Surface setup-version mismatch: once-per-version blocking ack (interactive) + loud verdict line (autonomous) (fn-95).** Every lifecycle skill already ran a fail-open version pre-check comparing `.flow/meta.json` `setup_version` against the plugin manifest, but the on-mismatch signal was a one-line `echo` the host agent routinely buried (this repo ran 2.6.0-era local files against a 2.12.x plugin for weeks unnoticed). This spec changes only what happens on mismatch; detection, its cost, and its fail-open posture are byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - **Interactive skills** (interview, plan, work, capture, tracker-sync, sync, make-pr, resolve-pr, qa, prime, map, audit, memory-migrate, ralph-init, prospect, strategy) now escalate a mismatch to a **blocking `AskUserQuestion`** with a frozen three-option set (`Refresh now` / `Remind me next version` / `Skip this run`), asked at most **once per plugin version**. A new optional `.flow/meta.json` field `version_ack` (a plugin semver, written skill-side via jq + same-dir tmp + atomic `mv`, no new flowctl subcommand) records "asked about version X, chose not to refresh" so users are never re-nagged for a version they dismissed; a later plugin version re-arms the question. The question is suppressed under the autonomy-marker family setup already honors (`FLOW_RALPH=1`, `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` set, `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1`, `ARGUMENTS` contains `mode:autonomous`), falling back to the one-line echo. All reads/writes fail open. (task .1)
  - **Autonomous skills** (`/flow-next:pilot`, `/flow-next:land`) never block and never ask; on mismatch they stash and emit a grep-able `SETUP_STALE: local v<X>, plugin v<Y>, run /flow-next:setup` line immediately **before** the terminal `PILOT_VERDICT` / `LAND_VERDICT` line (co-located so it survives into transcript-blind driver logs). `version_ack` does NOT suppress it (logs are cheap). Emitted at every terminal verdict site including the hard-guard exits; fail-opens to nothing. (task .2)
  - No detection change, no receipts-schema change, no non-interactive setup-refresh mode, no auto-running setup from another skill. `flowctl init` / `doctor` tolerate `version_ack` (unknown keys already ignored). Codex mirror regenerated (the sync script rewrites `AskUserQuestion` to the numbered-prompt instruction; the `SETUP_STALE` lines carry verbatim).

### Fixed

- **tracker-sync: merge base must snapshot the STORED tracker body, never the sent render (fetch-back rule).** Trackers rewrite markdown on save - Linear (confirmed live 2026-07-11) auto-linkifies slash-joined filenames (`CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md` -> `[..](<http://...>)`), inserts blank lines before list blocks, and turns `>`-leading list items into blockquotes; Jira Cloud round-trips ADF (lossy by design). A merge base seeded from the `renderFlowToTracker` output that was SENT therefore false-diverges on the next reconcile (observed: 149 diff lines, zero human edits, echo-fence reported a conflict). [`body-merge.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/body-merge.md) Step 5 gains the transport-blind **Fetch-back rule** (re-`fetchIssue` after every `writeIssue` on every base-snapshotting path - Step 5 write-back, flow-first bootstrap, Phase 2a link, create-if-unlinked; GitHub/GitLab store verbatim but the one extra bounded read keeps the rule uniform), plus renderer-hygiene notes; [`steps.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/steps.md) call sites updated; Linear normalization documented in both rung gotchas ([`linear-graphql.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/linear-graphql.md), [`linear-mcp.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/linear-mcp.md)). Codex mirror regenerated. Docs/prompt-level only - no flowctl change.

## [flow-next 2.12.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Model-routing scaffold: speed column + Grok 4.5 target + grok CLI bridge.** The optional routing table (`/flow-next:setup` scaffold, `templates/model-routing-snippet.md`) gains a **speed** column (1-10, at default reasoning effort - so the reasoning-heavy frontier models score low because they think before answering, which is what you feel) and a **grok-4.5** row (cost 9 / speed 9 / intelligence 7 / taste 5): fast, cheap, Opus-class coding but weaker on UI and higher hallucination, so it is routed to bulk/implementation, never final taste-critical or UI work. Values grounded in Artificial Analysis throughput (haiku ~95 t/s, grok ~90 t/s), hands-on developer reviews, and a 30-day social sweep. The cost caption is sharpened to say what it actually measures - **subscription-quota lightness** (how freely you can reach for it before hitting plan limits), NOT list $/token, with each provider a separate budget. `.flow/usage.md` gains the fourth headless bridge recipe, `grok -p` (xAI's one-shot: prints to stdout and exits; `-m grok-4.5-high`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--json-schema`, `--always-approve` to let it act). Both `grok -p` and `cursor-agent --model grok-4.5-high` (via `review.backend cursor:grok-4.5-high`) verified live. Setup's probe-composition transform gains a third `<!-- probe:grok -->` gate (`command -v grok`); the scaffold test now exercises all three CLI probes. **Routing only activates when a user prompts for it** - defaults are unchanged. Scaffold block stays within the ~45-line budget (37). Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 2.12.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Delegation default → `gpt-5.6-sol` (was `gpt-5.5`).** `work.delegateModel` now defaults to GPT-5.6 Sol. Delegated implementation via `delegate:codex` is **real work**, not a cheap-bulk lane — so it routes to the strong tier, never a cheaper one (this is the deliberate counterpart to 2.12.1's scaffold, where `gpt-5.6-terra` is the cheap *reads* tier and Sol is the codex *work* tier). `delegateEffort` stays `medium`. **Caveat — hard floor, no fallback:** unlike the review backends (fn-76 gave them a resolve-strongest-available ladder), the delegation path passes `-m` explicitly with **no resolution ladder**, so this default requires **codex CLI ≥ 0.144** (older CLIs 400 with "requires a newer version of Codex"). Users on an older codex CLI must `flowctl config set work.delegateModel gpt-5.5` until they upgrade, or porting the fn-76 ladder to the delegation path is a follow-up. Config default + comment updated ([`flowctl.py`](plugins/flow-next/scripts/flowctl.py)), `codex-delegation.md` reference prose + examples updated (codex mirror regenerated), five config-default tests repinned (`test_work_delegate_config`, `test_pilot_backlog_substrate`, `test_pipeline_qa_config`, `test_land_config`, `test_artifacts_config`).

## [flow-next 2.12.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Model-routing scaffold — GPT-5.6 numbers (Sol/Terra) in the example table.** GPT-5.6 (Sol, Terra, Luna) went GA 2026-07-09; the optional routing scaffold that `/flow-next:setup` offers to write into a project's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` still shipped `gpt-5.5` as its OpenAI row. Refreshed the starting-opinion scores in [`skills/flow-next-setup/templates/model-routing-snippet.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-setup/templates/model-routing-snippet.md): `gpt-5.5` → `gpt-5.6-sol` (cost 8 / intelligence 9 / taste 6 — Artificial Analysis has Sol one point below Fable 5 at ~⅓ the cost, ~54% more token-efficient than 5.5 on agentic coding) plus a new `gpt-5.6-terra` row (cost 9 / intelligence 7 / taste 5 — the cheap tier for bulk *reads*/digests only, not implementation; delegated work stays on sol). The two `probe:codex` wiring lines now name the 5.6 family (sol for `delegate:codex` work, terra for the thin-wrapper read), and the provenance line carries an explicit **"as of Jul 2026"** stamp so the scores announce their own staleness (instruction files decay silently). Scores are starting opinions, not defaults — edit down after scaffolding. Codex mirror regenerated; the [`orchestration.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md) illustration matches; all 22 `test_model_routing_scaffold` checks pass. **No behavior change** — runtime `work.delegateModel` and codex model resolution are unaffected (fn-76 already resolves the strongest available model on the codex backend).

## [flow-next 2.12.0] - 2026-07-10
### Changed

- **make-pr reviewer-effort reduction — risk-ranked review surfacing + reviewer guidance (fn-93).** As agentic throughput rises, PRs get bigger and more numerous and reviewers don't know *where to look* (external-team AI-SDLC field feedback, 2026-07-10). The methodology's promise is that a human carefully reads only the **~20-30%** of a diff that carries real judgment risk — but the old make-pr body listed a "Where to look" reviewer-focus list with **no skip-confidence** (which 70-80% is safe, and why) and **no trust calibration** (what the pipeline already verified vs what needs human eyes). The render contract (`skills/flow-next-make-pr/workflow.md` Phase 2) now replaces "Where to look" with two eval-validated constructs:
  - **`## How to review this PR`** (new, §2.4c) — a ≤~8-line trust-calibration coaching block: what the pipeline verified mechanically (test/gate evidence, cross-model review verdicts, R-ID coverage) and therefore what the human's job actually is (judge the must-review bucket, spot-check trust, own the calls machines can't — product intent, API taste, risk appetite). **No-overclaim rule:** only verification present in the payload is cited; absent verification is stated honestly ("no cross-model review recorded on this PR"). Always rendered — the frame is valuable even on a one-file PR.
  - **`## Review plan`** (§2.4d, replaces `## Where to look`) — every changed area lands in exactly one of three **risk** buckets (`### Must review (~X%)` / `### Spot-check` / `### Safe to skim`), bucket percentages estimated from diff churn. Must-review items carry WHY risky (one clause, payload-traced) + WHAT to check (one concrete reviewer-answerable question) + the specific symbol/function to open. **Focus budget:** must-review targets ≤~30% of changed lines, carving mechanical subsets out to safe-to-skim when it would exceed. **Derived-file rule:** generated mirrors, byte-identical dual copies, and task-state files always land in safe-to-skim with the derivation named ("regenerated by sync-codex.sh, guard-verified"; "byte-identical copy, parity-tested") — never counted as review risk. Tiny PRs (<~100 lines) collapse honestly to a single must-review bucket.
  - Pure prose change to the render contract — **no flowctl/payload changes** (fn-86 owns the deterministic slice; this render degrades gracefully when those fields are absent). Existing hallucination guardrails extend to the new sections: paths only from `diff_summary.files[]`, every WHY traces to payload data, no invented verification claims.
  - **Eval-validated (prbeval, real PR #203 payload, blind codex judge):** the shipped contract scores **9/9/9/9** (reviewer-effort / trust-calibration / actionability / honesty) vs the baseline **7/5/8/8** — the load-bearing pieces in measured order: the coaching block (trust 5→9), three-bucket ranking with a hard focus budget, per-item what-to-check questions, the derived-file rule. Buckets *without* the coaching + budget regressed (must-review ballooned to ~55%). Codex mirror regenerated; smoke prose contracts guard the new section names.

### Added

- **make-pr reviewer-ease — deterministic traceability slice in `export-cognitive-aid` (fn-86).** fn-93's eval-validated "Review plan" render is only as trustworthy as its data: the blind-judge evidence (prbeval 2026-07-10) showed a traceability table *without* deterministic backing scored **worse than none** (V3 trust 7 vs V2's 9 — "weakly supported"), a byte-identical dual-copy file inflated apparent risk, and the judge's residual complaint every round was "no line/hunk anchors". This spec adds the small deterministic slice that turns those render claims into repo-verifiable data — four **additive** fields on `flowctl spec export-cognitive-aid`, all reproducible from repo state at export time with **no LLM judgment inside flowctl** (the render layer judges, the payload reports). Each maps 1:1 to a measured gap:
  - **`diff_summary.files[].changed_symbols`** — the function/section context per changed file, parsed from `git diff` hunk headers (the `@@ … @@ <context>` line git derives from its per-language xfuncname detection). Gives must-review items their anchors ("open `_dispatch_review_with_fallback`") — the judge's #1 residual. Empty per file where git can't detect a function; the render falls back to file-level anchoring, never fabricates.
  - **`diff_summary.files[].derived`** — `{kind: mirror|dual-copy|state|none, source}` classification so the render can bucket generated / copied / bookkeeping files as safe-to-skim with data behind it. A dual-copy **verified byte-identical to its named source at export time** is `dual-copy`; a **drifted** copy is `none` (a real review item, not safe-to-skim). Rules come from the optional `makePr.derivedPaths` config leaf (default = flow-next's own shapes: the `plugins/flow-next/codex/` mirror, the `.flow/bin/flowctl.py` ↔ `plugins/flow-next/scripts/flowctl.py` dual copy, `.flow/` state); projects override, never required.
  - **`removed_export_refs`** — top-level symbols DELETED in the diff that are STILL referenced elsewhere in the repo (the classic silent-breakage class a skimming reviewer misses). Conservative candidates-not-proof: word-boundary `git grep` over the working tree, bounded to the diff's source extensions; each entry `{symbol, defined_in, refs: [{path, line, text}]}`. Empty ⇒ the render states "no removed symbols still referenced (checked at export time)". False positives are acceptable (they steer a human look); completeness is never claimed.
  - **`tasks[].evidence.files`** — each task's claimed files (recorded at `flowctl done` time) surfaced verbatim so the render maps task → files → commits without re-deriving.
  - **Additive + graceful:** absent/empty fields render nothing, so specs without the relevant signal and older payload consumers are unaffected (no schema version bump, no new flags). The make-pr **render consumption** of these fields ships with fn-93's "Review plan" contract (`skills/flow-next-make-pr/workflow.md` §2.4c/§2.4d, PR #204) — it references `changed_symbols` (symbol anchors), `derived` (safe-to-skim bucketing), and the review signal opportunistically, degrading gracefully when the payload lacks them. Docs: [`flowctl.md` § export-cognitive-aid](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md). Dual flowctl copies; unit-tested (`test_export_traceability.py`).

## [flow-next 2.11.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Smart model resolution — strongest available, never fail on the default (fn-76).** Review backends no longer inject a fixed hardcoded model on the unconfigured path — a single hardcoded default can't know per-user / per-plan / per-CLI-version availability (the GPT-5.6 launch reproduced it live: `gpt-5.6-sol` ran on cursor, 400'd on codex CLI < 0.144, and was rejected by copilot 1.0.65 — three answers for one string on one machine). Instead flow-next resolves the **strongest model the account can actually run**, and this **removes the interim 2.10.3 hardcoded-default caveat** by making the ranking's top entry the default:
  - **Ranking, not a set.** Each backend's model catalog is now a curated **quality ranking** (strongest first); the top entry IS the encoded default (`codex` → `gpt-5.6-sol`, `copilot` → `gpt-5.5`, `cursor` → `gpt-5.6-sol-high`). The ranking is a *preference*, never a parse gate — an **unknown explicit model warns and is accepted** (the CLI is the availability authority); the reasoning-effort axis stays strict.
  - **Optimistic-first (zero happy-path overhead).** The top model dispatches directly — no probe, no list call, no extra subprocess. On a current CLI the argv is byte-identical to a hardcoded default.
  - **Fallback ladder, on the distinctive failure only.** If that dispatch fails with the backend's model-unavailable signature (codex *"requires a newer version of Codex"* / model-not-found; copilot *`… from --model flag is not available`*; cursor *`Cannot use this model: …`*, captured live), flow-next resolves a fallback — **cursor** consults `cursor-agent --list-models` and picks the best `list ∩ ranking`; **codex/copilot** step down the ranking (max 2 steps). The terminal **floor** never fails (codex omits `--model`; copilot/cursor use `--model auto`, effort dropped). Any *other* failure (auth / network / sandbox / timeout) propagates unchanged. A ladder retry is the **same review round** — it does not consume an extra review-cap iteration (fn-90).
  - **Per-CLI-version cache.** The resolved fallback is memoized in `.flow/.cache/model-resolution.json` (atomic, gitignored, corrupt-safe) keyed on `(backend, CLI version)`, so the one failed round-trip after a ranking-top bump is paid at most once per CLI upgrade. Explicit model pins bypass ladder + cache entirely and stay byte-identical to before.
  - **Hygiene.** One stderr warning per downgrade/floor naming what was tried and what ran; the receipt records the model **actually used** (else `"auto"` / `"default"`). New docs: [`flowctl.md` § Model resolution](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md) + a [troubleshooting entry](plugins/flow-next/docs/troubleshooting.md).

## [flow-next 2.10.3] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Cursor review default → `gpt-5.6-sol-high`** (GPT-5.6 Sol, 1M context) — verified live via `cursor-agent --list-models` before the swap; the full Sol effort ladder plus `gpt-5.6-terra-high`/`gpt-5.6-luna-high` join the cursor model catalog. **Codex accepts `gpt-5.6-sol` explicitly** (for CLIs ≥ 0.144) but its default stays `gpt-5.5` — a live probe showed current codex CLIs 400 on it ("requires a newer version of Codex"), and copilot 1.0.65 rejects it outright, so swapping those defaults today would break the happy path for anyone not on the newest CLI (the exact fn-74 Finding-A failure mode). Those defaults move when the CLIs catch up — or, properly, when **fn-76** (smart model resolution: CLI-native/auto defaults, availability probe, fail-soft retry) lands and removes the hardcoded-default class entirely; this is the verified interim.

## [flow-next 2.10.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Capture's read-back is now a plain-language ratification, and the agent never pre-blesses its own guesses** — the companion to 2.10.1's interview contract, applied to the single most handover-critical question in the system: the Phase 4 approval where a human ratifies the synthesized spec. The read-back body now opens with one sentence of stakes ("approving turns this into the plan the team builds from"), lists **every acceptance criterion's substance in one plain line inside the question** (not only in the draft file), and translates the machinery instead of presenting bare shorthand ("labeled R1-R5 so each can be tracked"; "[inferred] = something I added that you didn't say outright"). **New no-self-blessing rule:** while the draft carries unverified `[inferred]` items, the recommendation is never `approve` — it is "check the N guessed items before choosing"; only a zero-inferred draft may lead with `Recommended: approve`. Option descriptions state their consequences ("this becomes the spec and work can start" / "draft is thrown away"). Eval-validated blind before shipping (same langeval harness as 2.10.1): the current read-back scored legibility 7 / **ratification-safety 4** / precision 8 — the judge's finding was that "Recommended: approve — the inferred items are reasonable" biases the user toward rubber-stamping exactly the items they exist to verify; an intermediate language-only variant fixed legibility but lost the criteria substance (precision 5); the shipped contract scores **9 / 9 / 10**. Interaction Principles gain the same plain-language contract as interview; sizing stays priorities-not-caps (GPT-5.6-safe).

## [flow-next 2.10.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Interview questions now carry a plain-language contract** (field feedback from the first external team: interview language "isn't plain enough" — jargon-dense questions disempower exactly the people the interview exists to hear). Every `AskUserQuestion` now opens with one sentence of stakes (what this question decides, in the audience's words), terms of art get a ≤1-clause plain gloss at first use ("counter-metrics — things we'd hate to make worse"), unexplained acronyms/tool shorthand are banned (business scope additionally bans implementation vocabulary), and every option description states its consequence ("Choose this if… / This means…"). Sizing is expressed as **priorities, not a length cap** — an always-keep list (stakes, recommendation, tier, glosses, consequences) plus a trim-first list (repetition, background, hedging) with a target shape of ~40-60-word bodies — deliberately following OpenAI's GPT-5.6 guidance that generic brevity instructions cause capable models to drop required content (flow-next interviews run on Codex hosts too). Eval-validated before shipping via a 5-variant × 2-fixture blind-judged loop: baseline legibility for a second-language PM scored 4/10 with 4.5/10 answerability at ~146 words/question; the shipped contract scores 7.5/7.0-8.0 with precision held at 8.5 and ~30% fewer tokens. The same loop tested extending the contract to spec write-back prose and REJECTED it (business sections already scored 9/10 PM-legibility; the contract made them 73% longer and worse on every axis) — spec prose is unchanged by design. Tier examples remodeled to carry the new shape; guideline echo in `questions-shared.md`.

## [flow-next 2.10.0] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Cursor review-backend loop runaway — root-cause fix, not a guard (fn-90)** — the first external team running flow-next live hit a review that looped **~11×** before converging (Gordon has never seen >3 on the default `rp`+Codex setup). Root-cause investigation (live repro on the fn-89 fixture, 3× cursor + 2× codex) found four confirmed causes, all now fixed backend-agnostically:
  - **The cap was prose-only and reset every invocation.** `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` (previously default 3) was just an instruction to the host LLM to keep an in-context counter — which reset to 0 on every fresh review invocation (a new Ralph iteration, pilot tick, or human retry), so the field loop was ≈ 5–6 fresh invocations × ~3 in-agent rounds. flowctl now owns a **cumulative round counter on spec state** (`plan_review_rounds` spec-scoped; `impl_review_rounds[<task-id>]` per-task; **completion reviews reuse the plan counter**) that survives fresh invocations and **refuses to dispatch at the cap** with a dedicated exit code `4` + an `ESCALATE:` marker (distinct from transport-failure `2`/`3` so a host/Ralph loop can't misread the refusal as retryable — surfaces as NEEDS_HUMAN). **Round-counting counts every dispatch attempt, including a failed/malformed exec** (deliberate anti-runaway bias — worst case is *early* human escalation). The counter resets only on a `SHIP` verdict or an explicit re-plan (`flowctl spec reset-review-rounds <spec-id>`), never on a spec/code edit. **The default cap is raised 3 → 4**: attempts-counting means transport flakes (a cursor timeout, a malformed exec) consume budget, so one extra round gives flake headroom while a ratcheted review still converges in ≤2.
  - **Every re-review was a fresh blind review** (churn lottery — two identical fresh cursor reviews overlapped on only ~50% of findings, making SHIP statistically near-unreachable within the cap). The re-review now injects the prior round's findings via a **shrink-only convergence ratchet** (verify each prior finding fixed; only a NEW ≥ Major finding may block; all prior fixed + no new ≥ Major ⇒ verdict MUST SHIP). Receipts stay back-compatible: one without the prior-findings field is treated as a fresh round 1.
  - **Codex/copilot verdict parse was poisonable** — a verdict literal echoed in tool output (`command_execution` / `aggregated_output`, e.g. a grep of `smoke_test.sh`'s assertions) or a quoted-grammar literal in the final message could beat the reviewer's real verdict (flowctl reported SHIP while the reviewer said NEEDS_WORK). The parse now isolates the **final agent message** and takes the **last** `<verdict>` match. Locked in by an offline regression guard (`optimization/review-prompt/reveval_parse_guard.py`, run in the gate).
  - **Cursor's ambient injection** (its built-in persona rubric + auto-attached workspace `AGENTS.md` / skills / MCP blocks — `cursor-agent` has no system-prompt mechanism) diluted the scope anchor and biased toward always-produce-findings (an amplifier, not the root cause). A **persona-override preamble** now rides in every cursor review prompt, declaring the ambient guidance superseded.
  - Plus: **031a0058 guard parity** ported to plan-review (MAJOR_RETHINK escalates instead of looping; the caller-reset warning), **spec/task-scoped receipt defaults** (`/tmp/plan-review-receipt-<spec>.json`, `-<task>.json` — concurrent reviews no longer collide; explicit `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` still wins), and docs across `orchestration.md` / `flowctl.md` / `ralph.md` / `troubleshooting.md`. No version bump (batched release convention).

## [flow-next 2.9.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **completion-review tracker audit was dead — event key never matched its config leaf** — the work skill dispatched and audited the completion-review tracker touchpoint with the event tag `work.completionReview`, but the config leaf is TOP-LEVEL `tracker.perEvent.completionReview` (fn-66). `flowctl sync check` resolves an event tag to its leaf via `tracker.perEvent.<event>`, so the `work.`-prefixed tag resolved no leaf → the event was treated as configured-off → the end-of-run audit could **never report the touchpoint missing** (and a dead dispatch could never retro-fire). Found during the fn-90 review-loop investigation's cross-backend re-review of fn-89 (three cursor + two codex reviews independently flagged the key mismatch). The event tag is now the top-level `completionReview` everywhere (work phases audit list + dispatch line, tracker-touchpoints reference, tracker-sync Phase 0 example list, tracker-sync doc); the config leaf is unchanged, so existing user configs written by the discovery ceremony keep working. Regression coverage: `test_sync_check.py` gains a parity class asserting the top-level key round-trips the audit (enabled + no receipt → MISSING; tagged receipt clears), that the old `work.`-prefixed shape resolves no leaf (the silent failure mode), and a prose guard that fails if any canonical skill/doc reintroduces the mismatched tag.

## [flow-next 2.9.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:refine` no longer silently defaults to a technical interview** — invoking the interview without a scope flag used to run the `--scope=technical` default (1.0.2 backward-compat), which meant a product manager typing `/flow-next:refine <spec-id>` got a stack/architecture/API interrogation they don't own, with no signal that a business mode exists. The skill now asks ONE upfront scope question (`business` / `technical` / `both`) when no `--scope` / `--biz` / `--tech` flag is passed, with a recommendation derived from the target's current state (both biz+tech empty → `both`; biz populated, tech empty → `technical`; 1.0.2-shape tech-only spec → `technical`). An explicit flag skips the question entirely; `technical` remains the fallback when the question can't be asked (tool unreachable). Plumbing: `flowctl scope resolve --json` now emits a `defaulted` boolean alongside `scope` + `remaining_args`. The Codex mirror gets the same question via the standard plain-text numbered-prompt transform — no platform is excluded.

### Added

- **Skipped interview questions are no longer silently answered with assumptions** — the interview leads every question with a recommendation, but the skill previously defined no semantics for a skipped/declined/"I don't know" answer, so the agent's recommendation could flow into the spec as *decided* content (e.g. project-rails-derived stack choices written as "chosen because…" plus founding ADRs — exactly what a downstream team's PM-led interview hit). New skip contract in the interview skill: (1) a skip/decline/no-signal NEVER resolves to the recommendation — only an explicit answer or an explicit "you decide" delegation does; (2) skipped questions park under `## Open Questions` with an owner hint and the agent's *unconfirmed* leaning; (3) a skipped user-judgment question never demotes to codebase-/docs-answerable backfill; (4) when ≥1 question was skipped, a consent checkpoint fires BEFORE write-back — `park-open` (default) / `fill-assumptions` (recommendations written with inline `*(assumed — unconfirmed)*` markers + an Open Questions pointer for later ratification) / `re-ask`; (5) the completion summary reports skip count + disposition. Projects can additionally pin scope discipline repo-locally via the existing `SPEC.md` scaffold-override cascade (guardrail annotations on technical sections) — the upstream contract makes that optional rather than necessary.

## [flow-next 2.8.1] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **model-routing scaffold — named tiers + menu-shaped wiring** — the scores table lists concrete models (`fable-5`, `opus-4.8`, `gpt-5.5`, `composer-2.5`, `sonnet-5`, `haiku-4.5`; "session model" is now a ROLE — whichever row you run as the conductor — not a row annotation, since fable won't always be the session model), and the wiring section became a per-role MENU instead of fixed pairings: implementation routes to native opus/sonnet subagents (model parameter), gpt-5.5 (`delegate:codex` or a direct `codex exec` bridge), or composer-2.5 (`cursor-agent` bridge); reviews cross-family via codex/cursor or same-family heavy via a prompted opus/session-model reviewer; bulk reads native (haiku/sonnet) or via cursor-agent scouts — bridge recipes referenced from `.flow/usage.md` § Orchestration & model steering. The harness picks per task, with an explicit freedom grant: unless prompted otherwise it routes as it judges best, and an explicit user instruction always overrides the table. Block is 37 lines (≤ ~45 budget). Downstream (at release): re-sync the verbatim block on the flow-next.dev `/orchestration/` page (done ahead of release 2026-07-05).

## [flow-next 2.8.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Orchestration usability — steering recipes where agents already look, plus an optional setup routing scaffold (fn-88)** — 2.7.2 shipped the orchestration & model-routing reference ([`docs/orchestration.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md)), but that doc lives *outside* the repo a user works in; at use time the host agent reads `.flow/usage.md` and the project's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and neither said a word about routing. This closes the discoverability gap on two surfaces agents actually read. **`.flow/usage.md`** gains an unconditional `## Orchestration & model steering` section (ships in every project): agentic headless-bridge instructions for `codex exec` (read-only default sandbox, `--sandbox workspace-write` to implement, `-o` output capture, stdin `</dev/null` guard, self-contained-prompt/digest-back discipline, never touches git) and `cursor-agent` (`-p`, `--force` to apply, `CURSOR_API_KEY`, volatile model IDs via `--list-models`), a `claude -p` reverse-bridge recipe (drive Claude headlessly from a Codex/Cursor host — every direction works), harness-relative wording, plus the flow-next shortcuts that package the same bridges (`delegate:codex`, `review.backend` + per-task `review:`, prompted-orchestration examples) and links back to the doc. **`/flow-next:setup`** gains one optional, interactive-only ceremony question offering to scaffold a full **opinionated** model-routing example — a cost/intelligence/taste scores table + how-to-apply rules + the exact flow-next surface each route drives — into your `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, single-sourced in [`templates/model-routing-snippet.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-setup/templates/model-routing-snippet.md) (≤ ~45 always-loaded lines). Two truth-guards hold: routes to a CLI the `command -v` probe didn't find are written commented-out with an install note (no silently active route to a missing binary — enforced structurally via per-line `<!-- probe:codex -->` / `<!-- probe:cursor -->` sentinels + a deterministic line transform), and delegation opt-in may set `work.delegate=codex` but **never** pre-sets `work.delegateConsent` (the first-use consent gate stays live). The composed block is shown in full before writing (never a silent write), marker-fenced (`<!-- flow-next:model-routing:start -->` … `end -->`) for idempotent re-runs and clean removal by `/flow-next:uninstall`. The frame carries over from the docs: **defaults are pre-tuned and require none of this — steering is a capability, not a prerequisite.** No new flowctl commands or config keys. No version bump (batched release). *Downstream (at release): the flow-next.dev `/orchestration/` page gains the same "in your repo" pointer plus an availability note ("shipped in flow-next ≥ this version: setup scaffolds the table, usage.md carries the bridges") and the reverse-direction (`claude -p`) bridge guidance; its `/skills/setup/` page documents the new optional model-routing ceremony step; sanity-check the cost/intelligence/taste example tables stay consistent across repo docs, site, and the canonical snippet (composer-2.5 row verified present in all as of fn-88).*

## [flow-next 2.7.2] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **New doc — Orchestration & model routing ([`docs/orchestration.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/orchestration.md))** — Given the trend toward frontier-model orchestration (Fable 5 conducting; implementation, reviews, and bulk reads routed to cheaper/faster models via `codex exec`, `cursor-agent`, tiered subagents), this page maps every routing dial flow-next already ships and the steering principle behind them: skills are prompts executed by the host agent, so routing comes in **two composable methodologies** — deterministic parameters (config keys, flags, per-spec/per-task fields) and *prompted orchestration*, where the host's own intelligence routes per item ("decide per spec, by complexity, which model plans and implements it"), escalates conditionally on outcomes, and can prompt capabilities into existence that no parameter encodes (e.g. a Fable reviewer despite no `fable` backend rung). Covers the tiered subagent fleet (haiku scanners / sonnet scouts / opus auditor / inherit workers + the Codex mirror mapping), the `backend[:model[:effort]]` review grammar and its full precedence chain (per-task `review:` → env → config), `delegate:codex` implementation offload, per-spec `set-backend` fields for external orchestrators, a copy-paste CLAUDE.md model-routing table (durable role labels, volatile model IDs), the pilot+land driver-chaining recipe (`DEFERRED_TO_LAND` → land in one `/loop`), and the invariants that never route away (host judgment, consent gates, human-gated merge, independent verification). The frame throughout: **the defaults are pre-tuned to work well for everyone out of the box — steering is a capability, not a prerequisite.** Linked from the README, the doc index, and CLAUDE.md.

## [flow-next 2.7.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Codex hooks config parsed cleanly again — Ralph guards were silently disabled** (GH #198) — the generated Codex mirror `codex/hooks.json` (installed to `~/.codex/hooks.json` by `install-codex.sh`) carried a top-level `"description"` key. Codex's hooks parser (feature `stable` since Codex 0.142.x) accepts only `"hooks"` at the top level and hard-errors on any sibling key (`unknown field 'description', expected 'hooks'`), printing a warning on every invocation and ignoring the Ralph guard hooks entirely. `sync-codex.sh` no longer emits the key into the mirror (reproduced + verified clean against Codex CLI 0.142.5). The canonical `plugins/flow-next/hooks/hooks.json` keeps its `description` — that key is officially documented for Claude Code plugin hooks files; this is exactly the canonical-vs-mirror rewrite `sync-codex.sh` exists for. **Codex users: re-run `scripts/install-codex.sh` to replace the broken `~/.codex/hooks.json`.** Thanks to @TechupBusiness for the report and root-cause analysis (#198).

## [flow-next 2.7.0] - 2026-07-04

Fleet-wide capability & efficiency release: two adversarial-review passes (fn-87, fn-88) over the skill/agent fleet plus the fn-84 prose work — one new feature, broad correctness/safety fixes, progressive-disclosure efficiency, and seven A/B-verified model downgrades. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **`make-pr` — reviewer-ease PR body (go further than "list changes + where to look")** — the generated PR body now carries four new sections, all rendered from existing `export-cognitive-aid` payload fields (every claim still traces to a field; zero new investigation): **`Not in this PR (by design)`** (the spec's scope boundaries, so scope objections don't become review threads), **`Verification`** (per-task test evidence verbatim + an honest "no test-file change accompanies `<source>`" gap fact — never the inference "untested"), **`Review plan`** (an attention budget: every changed file bucketed 🔴 Careful / 🟠 Behavior-visible / 🟢 Tests / ⚪ Skim by a deterministic pattern table, plus a "careful-review surface: ~N of M changed lines" line), and an **`· inferred` provenance chip** on weak-provenance R-ID rows. The aim is to make PRs faster to review — telling the reviewer what to read first, what to skim, what was verified, and what's deliberately out of scope. Verified via the `optimization/make-pr/` eval harness (E7–E10 render-fidelity evals pass; existing E1–E6 unchanged).
- **`make-pr --update`** (fn-87 R21) — refresh an existing PR's body after resolve-pr / land fix rounds. The created body freezes at creation, so its R-ID coverage SHAs, Review-plan buckets, and SHA-pinned blob links describe a diff that no longer exists; `--update` re-renders Phases 1–3 against the current diff and `gh pr edit`s the open PR (the render is byte-unchanged, so E1–E10 hold by construction).
- **`/prime` evidence + scoring contract** (fn-88 P4–P7, P15–P19) — the AI-readiness assessment now demands criterion-ID-keyed scout output, retries then excludes a failed scout (never silently drops or fabricates a pillar), makes command-verification mandatory before a "runnable" ✅, adds three-state N/A scoring (a library is no longer capped below Level 5 by inapplicable criteria), threads a repo-root argument through, and gained quality-gated CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md handling with an *augment-existing* remediation path (create-or-augment the platform-correct file, not a no-op "create").
- **Review + planning + autonomy capability** — completion-review reverse-coverage scope-creep detection on all backends (fn-87 R4); plan-review derives reviewer anchors from the spec's Key-files (R20); plan consumes capture's `[inferred]` source tags + wires the previously-dead examples.md (R18); prospect's anti-sycophancy critique now runs as a real fresh-context subagent (R14); strategy update grounds drift against the repo, not the doc's word (R16); qa enforces screenshot/log evidence before a SHIP (R17); resolve-pr passes spec decision-context to resolvers so a fix can't reverse a recorded decision (R19); drive verify checks console + network, not just the DOM (R23); `/deps` surfaces deadlocked / cyclic / missing-dep specs it previously hid (fn-88 P1).

### Changed

- **Prose optimization (fn-84.1 — Tier A, eval-gated) — `plan` skill task sizing** — the plan skill now folds a feature's finalization work (docs + CHANGELOG + release-notes + CI/test-wiring) into a **single** task instead of splitting it per artifact, and treats the "7+ tasks → combine" rule as a ceiling, not a floor. Landed through the eval-gated autoresearch ratchet (`optimization/plan/` — 4 frozen fixtures incl. a non-flow-next repo and an override-respect case): **accuracy 15 → 16/16 with zero quality loss** (dependency-ordering held at ceiling). Skill-prose only — no behavior, marker, or flow change; +117 always-loaded tokens bought the correctness win. A companion prompt-trim was honestly discarded as unverifiable by the current eval surface (logged in `agent_docs/optimization-log.md`). First of fn-84's Tier-A suites. No version bump (batched).
- **Prose optimization (fn-84.4 — Tier A, eval-gated) — `make-pr` skill trim** — trimmed ~189 tokens (render-irrelevant rationale asides + a structural omission-clause dedup, verified body-equivalent) from the make-pr body-render prose (`workflow.md`), verified body-equivalent via `--dry-run` render against a risk-differentiated fixture (behavioral E1–E5 + a new Where-to-look risk-prioritization eval all held). Confirms make-pr is at its **safe-trim efficiency ceiling** (fn-82's phases.md fold already harvested the ~4.5k-token win; the remaining prose is render-load-bearing) and its Where-to-look reviewer-focus is **already risk-prioritized by design**. Skill-prose only; no behavior/marker change.
- **Model tiering — 7 subagents opus→sonnet, each A/B-verified** — `plan-sync` (fn-87 R13; a two-round *hardened* A/B, since it's the only Edit-authority scout), `flow-gap-analyst` (fn-88 P23; with a new CLI/API/agent-loop medium-translation table so it stops asking a CLI about "page refresh"), and the 5 retrieval scouts repo/context/docs/github/practice (A/B-verified quality-hold). `opus` is now used by a single agent (quality-auditor). The Codex mirror keeps these at gpt-5.5.
- **`plan` depth-tiers the scout fan-out** (fn-87 R12) — a `--depth=short` plan drops the 3 web-research scouts (practice/docs/github); requirements-gap analysis + the codebase scouts run at every depth. `--depth` now governs research breadth, not just spec verbosity.
- **`/prime` scout signal refresh** (fn-88 P8–P14) — the assessment scouts now detect 2025-era stacks: uv / bun / `compose.yaml` / mise / corepack, monorepo `apps/*` `packages/*` layouts, non-`main` default branches, GitLab MR/issue templates, goreleaser, Biome / simple-git-hooks / strict-via-`extends` — closing a wide class of false-fail / false-pass verdicts.

### Fixed

- **impl-review** — the per-task `review:` backend override was silently lost (an empty `${1}` positional in a tool call; fn-87 R1); rubric drift closed (Vocabulary criterion on all backends; R2); the fix loop now escalates `MAJOR_RETHINK` instead of fix-looping a design conflict (R3).
- **Autonomy safety** — `land` no longer auto-merges a PR whose QA receipt says `NEEDS_WORK` (fn-87 R5); `pilot`'s two-strike limit survives a tracker readiness re-projection that previously read as a human re-bless and re-dispatched a failing spec forever (R7); `work` bounds worker retries and runs a real red-baseline check (R6).
- **quality-auditor** — a hardcoded `git diff main` gave a false-clean audit on non-`main` default branches; it now derives the base and fails loudly rather than passing an empty diff (fn-88 P3). **spec-scout** reverse-dependencies are now recorded (they were produced then dropped, so autonomous backlog built downstream specs against un-shipped infrastructure; P2). **memory-scout** distinguishes a scan failure from "no entries" (P20).
- **Review-diff correctness** — the review subsystem's `base..HEAD` diffs became `base...HEAD` (13 sites), so a base branch advancing past the feature branch no longer shows its own newer commits as false reversions; plus completion-review status write-back, portable `awk`, and `sync` `CROSS_SPEC` wiring.

### Performance

- **Progressive-disclosure splits** — `interview` 847→528 lines (doc-aware + write-back → on-demand; fn-87 R8), `make-pr` 2010→1382 (post-render create/finalize → on-demand, render byte-unchanged; R10), `impl-review` opt-in `--deep/--validate/--interactive` phases (R9), `capture` HTML render lens (R11) — moving conditional machinery out of the always-loaded prompt (~5k–9k tokens off common paths).
- **Common-path short-circuits** — `tracker-sync` reconcile skips the body-merge / status / comment loads when both sides are unchanged (~13–17k tok/tick; fn-87 R22); `audit` change-detection went O(all modules) → O(changed) via a since-last-audit git gate (R15).

## [flow-next 2.6.3] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`flowctl anchor <task-id> [--json|--md]` — single-call worker anchor bundle** (fn-83) — the `/flow-next:work` worker's Phase-1 re-anchor (~8 discrete CLI/git reads: task + spec `show`/`cat`, `git status`/`log -5`/branch, `memory.enabled`, glossary + memory indices, dependency done-summaries) is now ONE deterministic, pure read; `worker.md` Phase 1 is wired to the single call (the bundle is a floor, not a ceiling — memory keyword-search and all further reads stay available, Investigation-targets/Design-context reads unchanged). Sections are the **verbatim captured stdout of the same production `cmd_*` functions** the discrete commands dispatch to, proven zero-loss twice: a byte-for-byte superset test (`test_anchor_bundle.py`, CI-locked) and a comprehension-equivalence eval (bundle 7/7 ≥ status-quo 7/7 on 3 frozen real tasks; harness at `optimization/worker-anchor/`). Fail-open — a broken section is reported inline and the worker runs that one read directly. fn-83's other half, a deterministic plan-sync skip-gate, was proven non-viable by its own cross-repo eval (a genuine false skip — semantic drift no path/token probe can see — plus a 6.7% true-negative skip-rate against a ≥50% bar) and is shelved, not shipped: plan-sync continues to spawn unconditionally, and the gate machinery was removed from the shipped CLI (decision record: `.flow/memory/knowledge/decisions/plan-sync-skip-gate-not-viable-2026-07-03.md`).

### Fixed

- **Plan-sync spawns now pass the `CROSS_SPEC` flag their own contract documents** (fn-83) — the `/flow-next:work` post-task plan-sync spawn prompt (phases.md 3e) never passed `CROSS_SPEC` despite the agent contract (`plan-sync.md`) documenting it, silently disabling cross-spec drift checking regardless of the `planSync.crossSpec` config. The spawn now reads that single config leaf and passes the flag; plan-sync's own prompt/judgment is untouched and the spawn stays unconditional. Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`.

## [flow-next 2.6.2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **`flowctl ready --spec` now honors spec-level dependencies** (GH PR #95) — `ready` only checked task-level `depends_on`, ignoring the spec's own `depends_on_epics`, so a spec blocked by an unfinished prerequisite spec still reported its tasks as ready. `next` and `ready --all` already gated on spec deps; `ready` now applies the same rule (dep spec missing or not `done` ⇒ blocked) and returns empty `ready`/`in_progress`/`blocked` lists plus `blocked_by_specs` (legacy alias `epic_blocked_by` co-emitted through 1.x, per the R31 dual-emit convention). Latent in the default workflow (Ralph uses `next`; `/flow-next:work` calls `ready` only on pre-validated specs) but hit immediately by external consumers calling `ready` per-spec. Regression-tested in `smoke_test.sh`. Thanks to Mike Bannister (@possibilities) for the report and original patch (#95).

## [flow-next 2.6.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Codex hooks config no longer written as a duplicate/deprecated key** — `install-codex.sh` still wrote the **deprecated** `codex_hooks = true` (which Codex warns on every run) and was blind to an existing `hooks = true`, so a config that already carried the modern key ended up with BOTH; and `flow-next-setup` Step 4b's naive `sed codex_hooks→hooks` migration could turn that pair into a **duplicate `hooks` key**, which is invalid TOML and silently breaks Codex hook loading. Both paths now converge through one idempotent, dedup-safe normalizer (`scripts/normalize_codex_hooks.py`, mirrored inline in the setup skill): exactly one `hooks = true` under `[features]`, zero `codex_hooks`, everything else byte-preserved, re-running is a no-op. Regression-tested (`test_codex_hooks_normalize.py`, 10 cases incl. the both-keys scenario). Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`.

## [flow-next 2.6.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **Skill prompt diet: progressive-disclosure gating, intra-skill dedupe, archaeology sweep** (fn-82) — where fn-81 cut *runtime re-emission*, this cuts the **always-loaded prompt weight** the hot-path skills carry on *every* invocation: default-OFF machinery inlined in always-read files, instruction blocks duplicated across always-loaded file pairs, and dev-time scaffolding shipped as runtime text. Skill-markdown only — no `flowctl` behavior changes, no prompt rewrites (move/dedupe/delete only), read-backs stay mandatory and user-authoritative. **~10.7k always-loaded tokens removed across 11 skills** with zero quality loss, via three levers applied safest-first (archaeology → gating → eval-guarded dedupe):
  - **Progressive-disclosure gating** (work, pilot) — default-OFF machinery moved behind a **forcing-sentinel gate** into `references/*.md`, which cost **zero tokens until Read** (Anthropic Agent Skills 3-level loading). work's three tracker touchpoints (first-claim / done / completion-review) → `references/tracker-touchpoints.md` behind the bridge predicate; pilot's QA-stage freshness probe → `references/qa-stage.md` behind `pipeline.qa`. Each gate emits an imperative the agent must act on (`GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read <ref> …`), **fails open** on probe/parse error (`RAW="$(<probe> 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1` on both producer and parse — no unguarded `| jq`), links one level deep, and no-ops silently on the default path. The safety nets stay inline: work's Phase-5 end-of-run `sync check` + four-state `Tracker sync:` summary, pilot's Phase 5/6 qa routing. **−984 tok (work) / −2207 tok (pilot)** off the default path. New `references/*.md` auto-mirror to Codex (`sync-codex.sh` wholesale dir copy).
  - **Intra-skill dedupe** (impl-review, spec-completion-review, interview, audit, prospect) — duplicated *explanatory* blocks collapsed to one authoritative site; short imperative rules stay repeated at their action sites (verbatim repetition is load-bearing). The review pair now resolves the backend in exactly one place (`workflow-common.md` Phase 0 — killing a double `review-backend` round-trip); interview's template-cascade walker survives byte-for-byte with both cross-refs repointed; audit's Replace/supersede flow single-sources to `phases.md`; prospect's python-picker is defined once. **−1.5k tok** combined.
  - **Archaeology** (tracker-sync, qa, map, memory-migrate, audit) — build-time `fn-N`/`fn-N.M` provenance and absolute `flowctl.py` line-refs stripped from always-loaded prose (allowlist keeps `R\d+` ids, `S-[A-Z]` fixture oracles, versions); tracker-sync adapter round-trip spike harnesses relocated to `agent_docs/tracker-sync-spikes.md` (dev archive — not shipped or mirrored); qa's fn-53 ownership scaffolding + transient proof-receipt removed. **~900 tok** always-loaded (tracker-sync + qa).
  - **Eval-guarded (baseline-first, both held full score)** — make-pr **folds** (not gates) `phases.md`'s per-phase Done-when checklists inline into `workflow.md` and un-force-loads the stub (checklists are consumed every run — gating would be net-loss): body held 5/5, **−4.5k tok/run**. capture single-sources the biz-routing table at the *consumer* (`workflow.md` §2.6, beside the drafting step — the inverse of the historically-reverted far-trim): suite held 15/15, **−630 tok/run**. Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`.
- **Skill runtime token plumbing: single-emission writes, round-trip elimination, fix-loop guards** (fn-81) — a fleet survey of all 28 skills (2026-07-02) found the hot-path skills re-emitting large content (spec bodies, review handoffs, review responses) multiple times per run and making redundant CLI round-trips; this fixes the runtime plumbing for token efficiency AND speed without quality loss — skill-markdown only, no flowctl behavior changes, read-backs stay mandatory and user-authoritative. **11 full-content re-emission sites and 13 redundant CLI round-trips eliminated across 12 skills**, via three patterns plus hardened guards:
  - **Single-emission spec writes** (capture, interview) — the drafted body is materialized exactly ONCE via the Write tool at a literal unique path (the Write render IS the user-visible read-back), revised via Edit-tool deltas with a full-file Read before each re-approval (one full emission per edit cycle — same cost as the old re-show), and consumed by `spec set-plan --file <path>` — no Phase-5 heredoc re-authoring, no separate autofix stdout print. Approve/edit/abort semantics and the 3-edit-cycle cap unchanged. **Path-persistence rule** throughout: bash vars do not survive across tool calls (including the draft path itself), so paths are literal agent-composed uniques; `mktemp` only within a single bash block.
  - **File composition for assembled prompts** (plan-review, impl-review, spec-completion-review RP sites + export-context) — content-re-typing placeholders (`[PASTE HANDOFF HERE]`, `[PASTE flowctl show OUTPUT]`, `[PASTE SPEC]`) replaced by deterministic composition: `rp prompt-get > file`, static criteria via quoted heredoc, `flowctl show >> file`. Zero content re-typing remains (scalar id/branch/focus slots stay), and untrusted reviewer/spec content is never interpolated through shell vars — the command-injection surface is closed.
  - **Single-entry review responses** (all three RP response handlers: impl-review, spec-completion-review, plan-review) — `rp chat-send` stdout is redirected to a unique response file and Read exactly once (that Read is the parse + fix-loop context); verdict/tally extraction greps the file. No duplicate full-body emissions.
  - **Round-trip eliminations** — every tracker `perEvent` gate reads its config leaf ONCE via the `LEAF=$(…)` pattern (7 double-read sites: capture, interview, plan, resolve-pr, work ×3); plan drops its post-write `show`+`cat` and duplicate `show --json`; interview's duplicate spec fetch is collapsed (fetch at Detect Input Type, reuse at write-back); deps runs ONE heavy per-spec loop instead of two byte-identical ones; make-pr's §4.6b live `gh pr view` refetch fires only when the local body-file assertion fails (hand-rolled-create bypass) — the happy path is a local grep; tracker-sync reconcile passes the just-written `.flow/specs/<id>.md` directly as `set-merge-base --flow-file` instead of re-emitting the merged body to a temp file.
  - **Guards hardened** — the fix-loop iteration cap (`MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS`, default 3, env-overridable) now lives in the backend-agnostic common fix loop and ALL backends (rp/codex/copilot/cursor) defer to it — never loop unbounded; both RP fix loops replace `git add -A` with snapshot-scoped staging (`git status --porcelain` before/after the fix, stage only the delta — pre-existing dirty paths are never swept in, collisions are surfaced and deferred); prime's scout-model prose realigned with agent frontmatter ground truth (7 haiku scanners + 2 sonnet judgment scouts). Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`.

## [flow-next 2.5.4] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **`flowctl task set-acceptance` / `set-description` now replace the whole section — H2-in-input layering fix** (fn-79) — found live in the fn-78 autonomous dogfood: agents routinely pass section content that begins with its own `## Acceptance Criteria (…)` H2, and the section plumbing mishandled that shape at two write sites (`task create --acceptance-file` embedded the rogue H2 verbatim as a sibling section; `patch_task_section` then treated it as a boundary, so every subsequent `set-acceptance` *layered* a new block above the old one — a cursor plan-review round was wasted on the resulting contradiction). All task-section write sites (`task set-description` / `set-acceptance` / `set-spec --description/--acceptance` / `create --acceptance-file`) now normalize content through a single helper: a leading H2 is stripped only when it matches the section's known-title-variant grammar (exact name, legacy `Criteria`/`criteria` word, optional `(`/`—`/`:`/`-` suffix — `## Acceptance Tests` is content, demoted, never stripped), and remaining H2 headings are demoted to H3 outside fenced code blocks. Writes are byte-idempotent (no layering), and a self-heal folds contiguous rogue title-variant sections from already-damaged files on the next section write — while a byte-exact duplicate `## Acceptance` still raises the existing duplicate-heading error. Pure stdlib; JSON output and error semantics unchanged.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:impl-review` and `/flow-next:spec-completion-review` no longer steer toward RepoPrompt where it cannot run** (fn-80, fn-78 fast-follow) — fn-78 gated the RepoPrompt *proposal* in `plan`/`plan-review`, but the two remaining review skills still called rp "Primary backend" and led their ASK-error/override hints with `--review=rp` on every host; on Linux/Windows without `rp-cli`, following that steering was a guaranteed runtime failure (`require_rp_cli()` → exit 2). Both skills (SKILL.md **and** each `workflow-common.md` Phase 0 — the guard is computed locally in every file whose text it gates, so the self-contained docs stay correct standalone) now compute the identical fn-78 eligibility guard — `RP_ELIGIBLE ⟺ uname == "Darwin" OR rp-cli on PATH` — and, when ineligible, their Backends summaries, "Backend at a glance" rp/"Primary backend" lines, and ASK-error/override hints steer only to the runnable configured backends `codex`/`copilot`/`cursor` (+ `none`). Steering only — **suppression is not a ban**: an explicit `--review=rp` / `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=rp` / `review.backend=rp` / per-task `review:` override still resolves to rp and hits the existing runtime error, `--review=rp` stays in the accepted-flag grammar, and the `workflow-rp.md` execution files are untouched; on eligible hosts every surface renders byte-for-byte as before. Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`.

## [flow-next 2.5.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Review CLI calls are now explicitly foreground-blocking in the review skills** — during the fn-78 autonomous dogfood, a work-stage worker subagent launched its cursor impl-review with `run_in_background` + a monitor and then idled on the already-finished review (background completion does not reliably resume a subagent context; the verdict sat unread until a manual poke). The backend CLI itself (`flowctl cursor|codex|copilot …`) was flawless — 8/8 invocations returned verdicts with correct session resume — so this hardens the *calling* discipline: `impl-review`/`spec-completion-review` `workflow-common.md`, `plan-review` SKILL.md, and the `worker` agent now carry an explicit **Foreground rule** (one blocking foreground Bash call with a generous 10-minute timeout; verdicts typically land in 1–7; never `run_in_background` + monitor/poll) plus a matching anti-pattern bullet. Codex-delegation's `codex exec` background-launch pattern is explicitly exempt (different, sanctioned pattern that polls a result file in foreground calls).

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:plan` and `/flow-next:plan-review` no longer propose RepoPrompt where it cannot run** (fn-78) — RepoPrompt is a macOS-only GUI app (its `rp-cli` bridge only exists there), yet both skills proactively dangled the rp path in their interactive setup on every host; on Linux/Windows without `rp-cli`, picking it was a guaranteed runtime failure (`require_rp_cli()` → exit 2). Both skills now compute a single POSIX eligibility guard — `RP_ELIGIBLE ⟺ uname == "Darwin" OR rp-cli on PATH` — at the top of their interactive-setup step and, when ineligible, drop every RepoPrompt *proposal*: plan's "Use RepoPrompt for deeper context?" research question (research defaults to `repo-scout`) and its "Review → RepoPrompt" option; plan-review's Backends summary, "Backend at a glance" rp/"Primary backend" line, and ASK-error/override hints (steering only to the runnable configured backends `codex`/`copilot`/`cursor` + `none`). **Suppression is not a ban**: an explicit `--research=rp` / `--review=rp` / `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=rp` / `review.backend=rp` still resolves to rp and hits the existing runtime error; on eligible hosts (macOS, or `rp-cli` present anywhere) every surface renders byte-for-byte as before. Codex mirror regenerated via `scripts/sync-codex.sh`; `flow-next-setup` untouched (its menu already gates on `HAVE_RP`).

## [flow-next 2.5.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **Subagent models: family aliases, tiered by task — no frozen versions** — the 11 scout agents were pinned to `model: claude-sonnet-4-6` (a superseded minor that rots when a newer Sonnet ships). They're now tiered with family aliases that track their family and match the task's cost/latency profile:
  - **`haiku`** (Haiku 4.5 — fast, cheap, strong tool-use/instruction-following) for the 8 pure config-scanners: `build-scout`, `env-scout`, `memory-scout`, `observability-scout`, `security-scout`, `testing-scout`, `tooling-scout`, `workflow-scout`. Sonnet 5 is overkill (cost + latency) for grep/glob/read-and-report; Haiku 4.5 actually **out-scores `gpt-5.4-mini`** (the model the Codex mirror already runs these on) on coding + tool-calling, at 3× less than Sonnet.
  - **`sonnet`** (Sonnet 5) for the 3 judgment scouts that do open-ended reasoning: `spec-scout` (cross-spec dependency reasoning), `claude-md-scout` (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md quality assessment), `docs-gap-scout` (inferring which docs a change breaks).
  - Unchanged: 8 heavy-judgment agents on the `opus` alias; `worker` / `pr-comment-resolver` `inherit` the session model.
  - **Cross-platform:** this Claude split exactly mirrors the intent already encoded in `scripts/sync-codex.sh`'s `map_model` (FAST `gpt-5.4-mini` vs INTELLIGENT `gpt-5.5`). Cursor consumes the same canonical `agents/*.md`, so it's covered. The Codex mirror is **byte-identical** after re-sync (8 `gpt-5.4-mini` + 11 `gpt-5.5`, unchanged) — `map_model` matches by family pattern, and `haiku` → FAST / `sonnet` (intelligent scouts) → INTELLIGENT produces the same output as before.

## [flow-next 2.5.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Windows `python3` Microsoft Store alias-stub breakage** (fn-77) — flowctl was unusable on the common Windows configuration where real Python is installed from python.org / the `py` launcher but `python3` resolves to the Microsoft Store **App Execution Alias** — a 0-byte reparse point (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python3.exe`, enabled by default) that is on `PATH` yet non-functional (prints *"Python was not found"*, exits **9009**). The old launchers hardcoded `exec python3` and the GH-35 `pick_python` helper tested `command -v` (presence, not function), so both selected the broken stub. The fix makes flowctl **just work** across every Windows invocation context (Git Bash / WSL, cmd.exe / PowerShell, Claude Desktop, native Codex / Cursor) with no user intervention and **no mac/linux regression**:
  - **Probe over presence** — a shared resolver (`scripts/lib/pick-python.sh`) and the self-contained launchers probe interpreter *functionality* (`<cand> -c "import sys"`, reject non-zero exit) in order `$PYTHON_BIN` → `py -3` → `python3` → `python`; the 9009 stub is skipped even though it is on `PATH`, while a machine with a working `python3` (and no `py` launcher) still selects `python3` first. The 12 copy-pasted `pick_python` bodies source the one helper.
  - **Dual launcher** — a `flowctl.cmd` batch shim ships alongside the extensionless bash `flowctl`, running the same probe under cmd.exe / PowerShell where the bash launcher's shebang is never honored (`py -3` preferred). CRLF / exec-bit handling pinned so Git Bash doesn't regress.
  - **`init` self-heal** — `flowctl init` re-stamps both `.flow/bin/flowctl` and `.flow/bin/flowctl.cmd` from in-module launcher constants, so an existing (pre-fix) install refreshes on the next `init` without a full `/flow-next:setup` re-run. A broken bash launcher is reached via the newly-delivered `.cmd`, a plugin auto-update, or the documented `py -3 .flow/bin/flowctl.py init` escape hatch.
  - **Direct-shebang sites swept** — `hooks.json` invokes `ralph-guard.py` via a bash wrapper that sources the resolver; `ralph.sh` runs `watch-filter.py` through the resolved interpreter array; the `qa` / `prospect` agent heredocs resolve an interpreter once instead of emitting bare `python3 -`. (Ralph mode requires Git Bash on Windows — the harness is bash.)
  - **Regression coverage** — a fake-9009-stub-on-`PATH` harness asserts the old `command -v` path selects the stub, the new probe falls through to a working interpreter, `$PYTHON_BIN` is probed (a broken override is rejected), and `py -3` is preferred when present; a real `windows-latest` CI job exercises `flowctl.cmd` (PowerShell/cmd) and the bash launcher (Git Bash) against the stub configuration.
  - **CI template + docs** — `docs/ci-workflow-example.yml` no longer hardcodes bare `python3 flowctl.py` (it probes for a working interpreter, `shell: bash`); `docs/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/platforms.md` document the fix, the probe order, the `flowctl.cmd` shim, the "Ralph requires Git Bash on Windows" constraint, and **both** recovery paths for a broken install — re-stamp via `init` and the manual disable-App-Execution-Aliases workaround.

## [flow-next 2.5.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Cursor review backend** (fn-74) — the cross-model review subsystem gains a fourth backend, `cursor`, parallel to `rp` / `codex` / `copilot` and selected the same way (`review.backend` config, `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND`, `--review=cursor`, or per-task/spec `cursor:<model>`). It shells out to Cursor's **`cursor-agent` CLI** in headless read-only mode (`-p --output-format json --trust --mode ask`, run with `cwd=repo_root`), so reviews are **Cursor-billed** (your existing Cursor subscription, no separate API key) and reach Cursor reviewer models the other backends can't in one place: `gpt-5.5-high` (1M ctx, the default), the `gpt-5.3-codex` family, `composer-2.5`, `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high`. A parity port of the `copilot` backend (fn-28) — no new review *features*, same Carmack-level criteria, same receipt schema, same session-resume, same validator/deep-pass shapes — wired through `/flow-next:impl-review`, `/flow-next:plan-review`, `/flow-next:spec-completion-review`, and `/flow-next:setup`.
  - **Backend foundation** (fn-74.1) — `cursor` added to `BACKEND_REGISTRY` / `VALID_BACKENDS` with a **new registry shape** (model accepted, `efforts: None` — Cursor **folds reasoning effort into the model name**, so `cursor:<model>:<effort>` is rejected); `require_cursor` / `get_cursor_version` / `run_cursor_exec` helpers; `flowctl cursor check`; and `test_cursor_run_exec.py` + `test_backend_spec.py` cursor cases (success / `is_error` / timeout / first-call-omits-`--resume` / resume-passes-id / `cwd=repo_root` / `--mode ask` read-only / prompt-too-large).
  - **Review commands** (fn-74.2) — `cursor impl-review` / `plan-review` / `completion-review` / `validate` / `deep-pass` writing `mode: "cursor"` receipts (`spec: "cursor:<model>"`, **no `effort` key**) with the same confidence/classification rubric, suppressed-count, introduced-vs-pre-existing, unaddressed-R-ID and protected-path handling as copilot.
  - **Skill + setup wiring + Codex mirror** (fn-74.3) — `workflow-cursor.md` for impl-review, `cursor` sections in plan-review / spec-completion-review, every user-facing `--review=rp|codex|copilot|cursor|none` string, `flow-next-setup` accepting `cursor` / `cursor:<model>`, and the regenerated Codex mirror (`scripts/sync-codex.sh`).
  - **Session model is resume-only** — the first call omits `--resume` and persists Cursor's generated `session_id`; a re-review resumes via `--resume <stored-id>` only when the receipt's `mode == "cursor"` (cross-backend → fresh). The opt-in LLM **triage judge** stays `codex|copilot` (a cursor user who enables `FLOW_TRIAGE_LLM=1` also needs codex/copilot present; with the judge off — the default — cursor reviews use the deterministic whitelist, zero extra dependency).
  - **Doc-drift closed** — the GrowthFactors cross-model-review spec already advertised "Cursor via its `cursor-agent` headless CLI"; fn-74 makes that published claim true.
  - **Docs** (fn-74.4) — repo (`docs/flowctl.md` cmd list + new `cursor` backend section + `review-backend` grammar example; `README.md` three backend lists; `GLOSSARY.md` cross-model-review backends; `docs/skills.md` + `docs/teams.md` enumerations; this CHANGELOG), plus the full downstream narrative chain committed in its own repos: **flow-next.dev** (the `review/workflow` Cursor row flipped coming→shipped + `review/receipts` `mode` field + `releases/changelog`), **AI×SDLC** (`guides/flow-next.md` backend list + `guides/code-review-tools-changelog.md` Cursor section), the **GrowthFactors microsite** (`spec/05-cross-model-review.md` tightened + re-rendered `dist/{gf,shd,shopfully,flooid}.html` + the bundled `code-factory-onboarding.html`), and the **Obsidian vault** flow-next notes.

### Changed

- **All review backends read files from disk — no prompt embedding** (fn-74) — `codex`, `copilot`, and `cursor` reviews no longer embed changed-file *contents* into the reviewer prompt (previously up to a ~500 KB budget). These CLI reviewers are agentic and run with `cwd=repo_root` + file access (codex sandbox, copilot `--add-dir`, cursor `--mode ask`), so they read exactly the files they need — matching `rp`'s long-standing Builder-driven context selection. Result: far smaller prompts (cheaper, faster) and `cursor` reviews no longer trip its positional-argv limit on any non-trivial diff. **Verified equivalent**, not assumed: on a ground-truth planted-bug file all three backends caught the same defects (codex's own audit verdict: *QUALITY=PRESERVED*), and on a 49-file diff codex still produced a verdict in ~64 file-reads (well under the historical "114 turns / no verdict" failure embedding was added to avoid). The now-dead `get_embedded_file_contents` helper and the `FLOW_{CODEX,COPILOT,CURSOR}_EMBED_MAX_BYTES` budget knobs are removed.

- **Sharper, leaner review prompts** (fn-74) — the Carmack review rubric gains an always-on **code-smell baseline** (Fowler _Refactoring_ ch.3 — Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Long Method, Duplicated Code, …) on **impl + standalone** reviews, and its four rubric blocks + output-format section are tightened (every machine-parsed marker preserved). Applied to **every backend** — codex/copilot/cursor (via `build_review_prompt`) and RepoPrompt (via the impl-review `workflow-rp.md` rubric); the efficiency trim also covers plan reviews. **Eval-validated**, not assumed: on a ground-truth corpus (correctness bugs + planted smells), detection rose **7 → 10/10** (the old rubric reliably missed Feature Envy / Data Clumps / Primitive Obsession) while the prompt shrank **~27% (−950 tokens)**, correctness detection stayed 5/5, and clean code was **not** over-flagged — confirmed on both codex (GPT-5.5-high) and RepoPrompt's GPT-5.5-high pipeline. **Plan reviews** additionally gain a targeted **spec-quality checklist** — the plan reviewer's reliably-overlooked items (a stated test strategy, observability for async/batch work, each task sized-for-one-iteration and correctly dependency-ordered, non-functional requirements) — eval-validated **8.0 → 9.7/10** for **+74 tokens**, no over-flagging of good specs (a leaner, targeted list beat a broad one, which diluted focus).

### Fixed

- **Copilot CLI 1.0.65 compatibility** (fn-74) — two drift fixes surfaced while validating the no-embed change. (1) **Session creation** — Copilot's `--resume` is now resume-only (errors `No session matched` on the first call) on POSIX as well as Windows, so `run_copilot_exec` uses `--session-id` for the first call and `--resume` afterwards, marker-tracked on both transport paths (was: POSIX always `--resume`, which failed on every fresh review). (2) **Model default** — the default Copilot model moves `gpt-5.2` → `gpt-5.5` (the registry default), and `gpt-5.2` / `gpt-5.2-codex` are dropped from the accepted Copilot model set (1.0.65 returns `Model not available`), so `copilot:gpt-5.2` is now **rejected at parse time**; review receipts now record the model actually run.

- **Per-task / per-spec review-backend overrides now route through the skills** (fn-74) — a task's `review: <backend>:...` (or a spec's `default_review`) is honored end-to-end: `flowctl review-backend` takes an optional task/spec id and resolves the per-task/epic override **above env/config** (canonicalizing short/tracker handles first via the standard resolvers), and `/flow-next:impl-review`, `/flow-next:plan-review`, `/flow-next:spec-completion-review`, and `/flow-next:work`'s per-task worker all pass it — so a task set to `review: cursor:...` under a `codex` project default actually reviews with **cursor** instead of silently using the project default. Every backend command also **defensively coerces a foreign stored spec to its own default** — `flowctl <backend>` always runs `<backend>`, so an explicit `--review=<backend>` / `flowctl <backend>` now **wins** over a stored cross-backend spec rather than shelling a foreign model or stamping a foreign `spec:` under `mode:"<backend>"` (previously codex/copilot honored a stored cursor spec and passed `gpt-5.5-high` to the wrong CLI). Short/tracker handles also resolve for `flowctl <backend> impl-review fn-N.M` (was: `Task spec not found`).

## [flow-next 2.4.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Jira tracker adapter** (fn-70) — `/flow-next:tracker-sync` gains a fourth tracker behind the same normalized, transport-blind adapter interface. Enterprise teams on Jira — the dominant enterprise tracker — can now mirror flow specs to their board (Cloud **and** Data Center / Server), and `/flow-next:pilot` backlog mode surfaces its async gap-questions to a Jira issue. **Zero special setup** — a standard Jira credential the company already issues (Cloud `email:API_TOKEN` or DC/Server `Bearer <PAT>`), never an OAuth app, webhook, or Atlassian Connect/Forge app; the spec-first floor applies when no credential is present. **REST-only, single-rung, NO MCP** (the official Atlassian MCP can't transition status / update fields / set links — the writes a two-way sync needs — and the community MCP is a redundant PAT-wrapper; the fn-70 transport decision).
  - **flowctl plumbing + ceremony** (fn-70.1) — `TRACKER_TYPES` extended to include `jira` so `tracker.type: jira` activates the bridge; the `set-tracker-id` identifier validator already accepts the Jira `PROJ-123` `KEY-N` form (tracker-first like Linear); new `tracker.perTracker.baseUrl` / `projectKey` / `authScheme` / `apiVersion` / `statusMap` / `sslVerify` config; and the discovery ceremony's three coupled sites (probe table, ASK step, config-write block) extended to detect, **offer** (flipping today's "surface but don't offer"), and write Jira — including a validated readiness **status name** for the promoted-lane JQL.
  - **`references/jira.md` adapter** (fn-70.2 / fn-70.3) — all nine adapter methods over the Jira REST `/rest/api/{3,2}` token transport → no-op ladder: the six core (incl. **Markdown ↔ ADF** body translation on Cloud v3, round-trip-safe over a documented subset with unknown-node preservation), **workflow-aware status** via the **transitions API** + a configurable `statusMap` (honoring the fn-66 terminal-status invariant — locally-`done` → In Review until merge, terminal Done gated on `MERGED` PR evidence; an unreachable In-Review→Done transition defers + receipts, never forces an illegal jump), the fn-64 relation pair via Jira native **"is blocked by" issue links** (directional, universally available — no licence gate, no degrade, **no `<!-- flow:deps -->` block**; read-before-write dedup + defer-on-human-removal), `listOpenIssues` via JQL (Cloud `POST /search/jql` cursor + DC/Server `/rest/api/2/search`), `authorAuthority` from `author.accountType`, and the make-pr PR link projected as a Jira **remote link**. Cloud-vs-DC auth labelled unambiguously; credentials read from env each run, never stored in flow state.
  - **Codex mirror + doc sweep** (fn-70.4) — `references/adapter-interface.md` (implemented-by table, `issue.tracker` enum, `authorAuthority`, terminal invariant, relation/`source` + `linkPresent` semantics, `listOpenIssues` Jira JQL match, marker-vocabulary) carries the Jira contract; the Codex mirror + `openai.yaml` registration include Jira; and EVERY stale "Linear/GitHub/GitLab" supported-tracker enumeration across `docs/tracker-sync.md`, `docs/flowctl.md`, `docs/skills.md`, `docs/teams.md`, `docs/README.md`, root `README.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, the `work`/`pilot`/`make-pr` skill prose, and the setup usage template now lists Jira.
- **GitLab tracker adapter** (fn-69) — `/flow-next:tracker-sync` gains a third tracker behind the same normalized, transport-blind adapter interface (modelled on the GitHub adapter). Companies on GitLab — a large share of self-managed and EU/regulated shops — can now mirror flow specs to their tracker, and `/flow-next:pilot` backlog mode surfaces its async gap-questions to a GitLab issue. **Zero special setup** — it prefers the `glab auth login` session a developer already has (or a `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `CI_JOB_TOKEN` already present, gh-style), never a flow-next-specific provisioning step; the spec-first floor applies when neither is present.
  - **flowctl plumbing + ceremony** (fn-69.1) — `TRACKER_TYPES` extended to include `gitlab` so `tracker.type: gitlab` activates the bridge; the `set-tracker-id` identifier validator widened to accept the GitLab `<project>#<iid>` form incl. nested group paths (`group/subgroup/project#12`) + bare `#<iid>`; new `tracker.perTracker.project` / `host` config defaults; and the discovery ceremony's three coupled sites (probe table, ASK step, config-write block) extended to detect, offer, and write GitLab.
  - **`references/gitlab.md` adapter** (fn-69.2) — all nine adapter methods over the `glab` CLI → raw-REST `/api/v4` token fallback → no-op ladder, reduced-fidelity status (open/closed + label), the `system==true` notes filter on pull, `authorAuthority` from project `access_level`, the global-issue-`id` durable dedupe key, the `flow:<id>` back-reference label, and dependency projection via native `is_blocked_by` issue links on a licensed namespace — degrading to a directionless `relates_to` + the provenance-fenced `<!-- flow:deps -->` block on a Free/personal namespace (403 `Blocked issues not available for current license`). Self-managed hosts honored via `glab`'s host or `CI_SERVER_URL`; the MCP route is documented as available-but-deliberately-unwired (Premium/Ultimate-gated, not universal).
  - **transport vocabulary + Codex mirror + doc sweep** (fn-69.3) — the receipt `--transport` enum + the SKILL/steps prose gain the GitLab rung (`glab` / `rest`); `references/adapter-interface.md` (implemented-by table, `issue.tracker` enum, `authorAuthority`, relation/`source` semantics, `listOpenIssues` GitLab label match, marker-vocabulary) and `references/body-merge.md` (the `<!-- flow:deps -->` fenced region is flow-owned on GitHub's fenced fallback *and* on GitLab every tier — native `is_blocked_by` and degraded `relates_to`) carry the GitLab contract; the Codex mirror + `openai.yaml` registration include GitLab; and EVERY stale "Linear/GitHub" supported-tracker enumeration across `docs/tracker-sync.md`, `docs/flowctl.md`, `docs/skills.md`, `docs/teams.md`, `docs/README.md`, root `README.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, the `work`/`pilot` skill prose, and the setup usage template now lists GitLab.

## [flow-next 2.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **`/flow-next:pilot` gains an opt-in backlog mode** (`pilot.autonomy=backlog`, default off, fn-68) — pilot widens from "advance one **already-ready** spec" to a **standing floor scheduler for the whole open backlog**. Each tick enumerates everything open (flow specs via `flowctl ready --all` + tracker issues at the promoted lane, unioned in by the skill), selects the top **dep-ordered** actionable item, **triages** it agentically, and — if it is a workable written spec — advances it one stage along the same `plan → plan-review → work → [qa] → make-pr` pipeline; when it cannot safely proceed it surfaces a precise **async question** and parks the item (`ASKED`), so "stuck" becomes a question, not a stall. This pushes the consent boundary from *before* the loop to **inside the loop, on block** — while holding the load-bearing boundaries: backlog mode **never authors a spec** (a thin/missing spec is surfaced as a "run `/flow-next:capture` or `/flow-next:refine`" gap, never auto-written), **never sets the `ready` flag** (promotion is the human's board act; un-promoted items are skipped silently), and **never merges** (land stays human-gated). Readiness stays the human's **explicit signal** (the fn-58 ready gate set OR tracker status exactly at `tracker.readyState`), never an agent-inferred completeness score. It is a **leftward extension of the same single-tick conductor** — one `/loop`/`/goal` target, one verdict grammar, one mental model, the host primitive still owning repetition — **not a new skill or command**.
  - **flowctl substrate** (fn-68.1, R1/R8/R9) — the `pilot.autonomy` (`ready \| backlog`, default `ready`) + `pilot.gateClasses` (force-gate class list) config keys; a backlog-wide eligibility scan `flowctl ready --all` returning **deterministic facts only** (`{id, ready, readySignal, blockedBy, hasSpec}`, **no** judgment `triageClass`); and a per-tick **decision log** `flowctl pilot-log append|summary` (frozen action enum `triaged|advanced|asked|blocked|needs-human` + host-reported token cost) stored under `.flow/pilot-runs/` — a sync-runs-style dir, **never** a ralph-guard receipt path. The agentic/deterministic line holds: flowctl enumerates + checks hard fields; the host agent judges *workable / thin / ambiguous* and formulates the question.
  - **backlog-mode core** (fn-68.3, R2/R3/R5/R13/R17) — `references/backlog-mode.md`: wide **dep-ordered** selection (pull-before-scan so a board move is reflected next tick, union tracker-only items, skip parked), **agentic** triage (the host's read of the spec, never a flowctl field), and the **spec-first floor** so the loop is fully functional with zero trackers configured. Multi-tracker (GitHub / GitLab / Jira / Linear) is inherited transport-blind through tracker-sync (v1 rides Linear + GitHub).
  - **pilot wiring** (fn-68.4, R1/R4/R6/R7/R10) — the autonomy gate + `--backlog` / `--auto` override, the `triage` / `ask` stages in front of the existing pipeline, the verdict-grammar additions (`ASKED <id> (<n>)` durable park; `TRIAGED <id> <class>` **diagnostic / `--dry-run` only**; `NO_WORK` / `DEFERRED_TO_LAND` kept verbatim; **no** `PROMOTED`), the async ask-valve, and the enforcing safety invariants (never-merge / never-author / idempotent surfacing).
  - **mirror + safety tests** (fn-68.5, R12) — Codex mirror regen + impl-review + autonomous-safety tests (no-prompt / never-merge / never-author).
- **tracker-sync is autonomous-safe on the pilot/backlog path + gains the backlog-mode enumeration + the async question-valve** (fn-68.2) — the substrate `/flow-next:pilot` backlog mode needs to run the whole open backlog unattended and surface "stuck" as a question, not a stall:
  - **Phase-0 autonomy parity (R14)** — the tracker-sync Phase-0 gate recognized only `FLOW_RALPH` / `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`; it now also recognizes `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` / the `mode:autonomous` token, matching `work` / `make-pr` / `resolve-pr` / `capture`. tracker-sync was the **one** lifecycle-participating skill whose gate omitted `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS` — under the marker NO path reaches `AskUserQuestion` (discovery ceremony, collision guard, genuine conflict, and `question` authoring all resolve "ask the human" to `sync defer`), so a per-tick backlog sync can never hang the loop.
  - **9th adapter method `listOpenIssues(filter) → issue[]`** (R15) — added to `adapter-interface.md` + implemented for **Linear + GitHub** (v1; GitLab/Jira inherit). Enumerates the **promoted lane** — open issues at the **exact** `tracker.readyState` state (Linear) / label (GitHub); exact-match, no ordering, no "beyond" lane. Returns normalized, transport-blind `issue` structs so pilot can union in tracker-only tickets `flowctl specs` can't see. **No-ops with a note when `tracker.readyState` is unset.**
  - **Named skill ops `list-open` + `question <spec-id | tracker-id>`** (R15) — skill-level + transport-blind (NOT flowctl transport). `question` posts a stable anchor `<!-- flow-next:question id=<hash> status=open -->` where `id` hashes **stable fields only** (`subjectId` + blocked-stage + reason code + question slug; free prose *outside* the hash so rephrasing never duplicates; `subjectId` is the spec id when spec-backed, else the opaque tracker UUID — never a bare tracker key). A human's reply carries `<!-- flow-next:answer id=<hash> -->`, matched by `id` (threaded on Linear via new optional `comment.parentId` reply/parent metadata; flat on GitHub via the body marker) and imported **under the matching `## Open Questions` entry**, flipping the anchor to `answered`. A **tracker-only** `question` is exempt from the spec-id sync receipt — its parked/answered state lives in the tracker comments, with no spec import until `capture`/`interview` later creates a spec.
  - **R16** reuses the existing status-sync `tracker.readyState` → local `ready` projection unchanged (no new mechanism). Tracker-sync stays **projection, not coordination** — it surfaces, never stalls the loop; no second-LLM spawn, no regex grader.
  - **Docs**: `docs/tracker-sync.md` documents the parity fix + `listOpenIssues` + the named ops; the skill `SKILL.md` / `steps.md` (new Phase 7) + `references/adapter-interface.md` / `comments-sync.md` / `github.md` / `linear-graphql.md` / `linear-ladder.md` / `linear-mcp.md` carry the contract. Codex mirror regen is a **separate task (fn-68.5)**.
- **Docs**: full documentation sweep for backlog mode (fn-68.6, R11) — repo (`docs/ralph.md` autonomy story incl. the consent-boundary-moves-inside-the-loop framing; `docs/README.md` skill index; `docs/flowctl.md` `ready --all` / `pilot-log` / `pilot.autonomy` / `pilot.gateClasses`; `GLOSSARY.md` backlog mode / triage stage / ask stage / decision log; `STRATEGY.md` autonomy track), flow-next.dev (backlog-mode section on the pilot page + the autonomous overview + the changelog; both navbars unchanged — pilot already listed), and the downstream narrative docs (AI×SDLC `guides/flow-next.md` pipeline/autonomy framing + the GF microsite autonomy section). The pilot `SKILL.md` backlog-mode wiring + verdict verbs were authored in fn-68.4; this task extends the surrounding docs.

### Security / hardening
- **Async question-valve answer authority (PR #181)** — a `flow-next:answer` marker is now honored **only from an authorized commenter**, never by marker `id` alone (anyone with tracker comment access could otherwise spoof an answer and unpark a question). The normalized `comment` struct carries `authorAuthority` (`writer | outsider | bot | unknown`), populated by each producer adapter (GitHub `author_association`, Linear team membership) and **fail-closed on `unknown`**.
- **Tracker linkage from sync state** — a tracker issue's linked/tracker-only classification is decided authoritatively by the local sync state (the recorded linked tracker-ids), never by `flow:<id>` label absence; a bounded/truncated label set is never read as "unlinked".
- **Cross-platform `pilot-log`** — the per-id decision-log tick counter is serialized by a cross-platform `os.mkdir` lock (replacing Unix-only `fcntl.flock`), tolerant of Windows transient `mkdir` errors, so concurrent same-id appends get distinct monotonic ticks on POSIX **and** Windows.

## [flow-next 2.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`flow-next-drive` native rung gains the Cua Driver (provider-agnostic computer-use) + a Cua Sandbox rung for headless/CI native runs** (fn-71). The native rung of the surface-aware driver ladder (Step 4) was served **only** by Computer Use (Codex CU / Anthropic Claude CU) — provider-locked, macOS/Windows-only, and focus-stealing, and **never reachable on a headless / CI / Linux path**. [trycua/cua](https://github.com/trycua/cua) (MIT) is added as a **detected, opt-in** native driver with two surfaces, never a hard dependency:
  - **Cua Driver** (`cua-driver mcp`, fn-71.1) — background computer-use on the *local* machine (macOS / Windows / Linux) over an MCP server: **no focus steal** (`launch_app` returns `self_activation_suppressed: true`), **accessibility-tree-based** (structured `element_index` elements, not pixels), and **provider-agnostic** (not tied to Claude/Codex). Validated live end-to-end against cua-driver 0.6.8. On macOS, the load-bearing **TCC permission split** is documented: **Accessibility** unlocks *driving*, **Screen Recording** unlocks *screenshots* — the rung surfaces "Screen Recording not granted ⇒ AX-only evidence, no screenshot" rather than emitting an empty screenshot.
  - **Cua Sandbox** (fn-71.2) — drives an app inside an isolated VM/container (any OS), the **only** native option on a **headless/CI** host with no real display. Opt-in per run, torn down each run; **local `lume`/QEMU/Docker is the default backend, the `cua.ai` cloud is explicit opt-in** (bills + data-egress, never auto-selected).
  - **Detect-and-instruct, never auto-install** — the same no-auto-install consent rule `/flow-next:map` applies to `clawpatch`; base install stays zero-dep, agent-browser remains the only assumed-present driver, and `flowctl` never imports Cua. The **default driving path (background `cua-driver` MCP) uses only MIT components**; the optional `cua-agent[omni]` (ultralytics AGPL-3.0) / OmniParser (CC-BY-4.0) extras are documented and never auto-installed. Native-rung precedence is explicit (attended: Cua Driver → Computer Use → documented-limitation; headless/CI: Cua Sandbox only). The `/flow-next:qa` evidence tuple accepts `cua-driver` / `cua-sandbox` as `driver_rung` values with no schema change — the fn-51↔fn-53 seam is unchanged.
  - **Docs**: a new per-rung reference [`references/cua.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-drive/references/cua.md) (install + multi-host MCP wiring, the AX-tree driving loop, the permission-split evidence mode, the precedence list, sandbox provision/teardown, licensing, a drift / verify-at-build section, and the degradation table); the `flow-next-drive` SKILL Step 4; `docs/skills.md`, `docs/platforms.md`; Codex mirror regenerated. flow-next.dev ships the counterpart drive-page + changelog pass.
- **QA as an optional pilot pipeline stage** (fn-72) — `/flow-next:qa` graduates from a user-invoked, off-to-the-side skill into an **opt-in, config-gated (`pipeline.qa`, default off), autonomy-safe pilot stage** that runs one live pass over the complete build at the **all-tasks-done** juncture, before make-pr: `plan → plan-review → work → **qa** → make-pr`. The app is already up on the dev's machine during `work`, so this is the cheap first live pass that catches obvious runtime breakage before a human opens the PR. It **augments — never replaces — CI/staging/manual QA**; like everything in flow-next it reduces human work agentically and **surfaces problems to humans** rather than gating them out.
  - **Lean + agentic, evidence-aware** (fn-72.1) — net-new flowctl is a single `pipeline.qa` config-key default (no new subcommand, engine, or persisted artifact); the host derives scenarios in-context and drives the local running app, reusing the existing `/flow-next:qa` executor. It reads `work`'s recorded evidence first and **subtracts only AC proven by a deterministic re-runnable check** (a real test/lint/build command), always live-running every runtime/UI/integration AC even when work narrated it done — narration is never SHIP-grade evidence. The `qa_verdict` receipt gains additive fields (`head_sha`, `rid_coverage`, `open_p0p1` objects) and stays the only persisted output. A `mode:autonomous` / `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` gate suppresses all prompts so the loop can never hang on a question.
  - **Pilot stage wiring + the principled Forbidden-list reversal** (fn-72.2) — pilot's "QA is never a stage" is reversed **only under the gate**: QA joins the classify table, branch matrix, dispatch list, and `PILOT_VERDICT` stage set when `pipeline.qa==on`; **capture/interview/resolve-pr/merge/release stay forbidden** (distinct loop-ownership / consent reasons — opening QA is not a precedent to open them). The stage is **idempotent** (a `head_sha` freshness gate classifies `qa` at most once per branch head — a single-tick pilot never re-loops) and the gate routes on `qa_outcome`, NOT the Ralph-guard `verdict` projection: `SHIP`/`NA`/`BLOCKED` advance cleanly, and **`NEEDS_WORK` still advances** to the draft PR — make-pr surfaces the findings in a new `## Live QA` section + the bug-memory track + a tracker-sync comment when the bridge is active. QA never hard-blocks the loop; merge stays the human's + land's decision. With the gate off, pilot's stage set and behavior are **byte-for-byte unchanged**.
  - **Docs**: `pipeline.qa` config row in [`docs/flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md); the optional `qa` stage threaded through [`docs/ralph.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/ralph.md), `docs/README.md`, root `README.md`, the qa + pilot + make-pr skill prose; Codex mirror regenerated + smoked. flow-next.dev + the AI×SDLC guide + the GF microsite ship the counterpart pipeline/QA framing passes.

### Notes
- Additive, opt-in, backward-compatible — a pass still completes with no Cua installed (fall to Computer Use → documented-limitation). No new skill or command (a rung, not a re-architecture); the universal flow and QA's workflow are untouched. Shipped together in the 2.2.0 batched release.
- The QA pilot stage is **off by default** — environments without a local app are never blocked (`BLOCKED`/`NA` advance), and the QA stage is host-agent skill wiring (no new subcommand/engine, no new receipt or artifact beyond the additive `qa_verdict` receipt fields). Shipped together in the 2.2.0 batched release.

## [flow-next 2.1.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:resolve-pr` now keeps GitHub review threads whose `isResolved` value is `null` in scope**. GitHub/GraphQL can surface newly-created unresolved inline review threads as `null`, not only `false`; the PR feedback fetch now treats only literal `true` as resolved. This prevents Codex/Bugbot inline findings from being silently dropped during full-mode and watch-loop review passes.

### Changed
- **Resolve-pr fetch observability is now mandatory in full mode and watch loops**. The workflow prints counts and previews for all three feedback surfaces — inline review threads, top-level PR comments, and review bodies — so automated-review wrapper comments cannot be mistaken for the full review signal.

### Notes
- Patch release — behavior fix and skill guidance only. No new PR mutation authority, no merge-policy changes, and no change to the bounded resolve/verify loop. Codex mirror regenerated and smoke/CI shape tests updated to pin the null-open thread rule.

## [flow-next 2.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **tracker-sync reserves Linear `Done` for *merged* PRs; an open PR maps to `In Review`** (fn-66 / FLOW-15). tracker-sync could push a projected tracker issue to **`Done`** when a Flow spec was *locally* complete (all tasks `done` + completion-review `ship`) **even though no PR existed or the PR had not merged** — the SapienXT incident (`fn-29` / `WOR-27` reached all-done + `SHIP`, closeout pushed `WOR-27` → `Done` with no GitHub PR and unmerged commits, and a human had to drag it back). `Done` is a claim about reality ("this shipped"), read by people who don't see the repo, so a premature `Done` is a correctness bug, not cosmetic.
  - **Merge-evidence gate** (fn-66.1): the flow→normalized mapping is now `flowToNormalized(spec, prEvidence)` — a function of `(spec status, completion_review_status, PR-merge-evidence)`, not spec state alone. **No** write path — automatic touchpoint OR a manual `/flow-next:tracker-sync` reconcile — may set the terminal `Done`/completed state without a GitHub-confirmed `MERGED` probe for the spec's `branch_name` (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` → `MERGED`). Local Flow completion is necessary, never sufficient. The invariant is **transport-blind** ([`references/status-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/status-sync.md), [`references/adapter-interface.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/adapter-interface.md)) — every adapter receives a terminal normalized status only after the gate. Worked-fixture matrix (no-PR / open / merged / closed-unmerged) added.
  - **make-pr → `In Review`, unconditional when bridge active** (fn-66.2): an open PR *is* the In Review lifecycle rung. make-pr now moves the linked issue to `In Review` (alongside the existing PR-link comment) on the same unconditional path that powers Linear Diffs — not gated behind `perEvent.makePr`.
  - **completion-review never terminal** (fn-66.2): the `completionReview` touchpoint is re-scoped from `reconcile` to a `comment`-shaped effect — it posts its verdict + R-ID coverage and at most leaves the issue at `In Review`, **never `Done`**.
  - **land/merge → `Done`, active-by-default + self-checked** (fn-66.2): `land.merged` is the **sole** Done driver and is **active-by-default when the bridge is active** (leaving it opt-in would strand boards at `In Review` after a real merge). The terminal write self-checks the `MERGED` probe; the `perEvent.land.merged` leaf, if set, only tunes the optional verdict comment, never the status.
  - **GitHub adapter parity** (fn-66.1): the GitHub adapter's reduced-fidelity terminal `setStatus(done|verified)` honors the same `MERGED` gate, so the bug can't regress via the back door.

### Changed
- **Pilot never returns terminal `NO_WORK` for an all-done spec lacking a merged PR** (fn-66.3). An all-done / completion-`ship` spec with **no** PR classifies `make-pr` and dispatches it; one with an **open** PR is land's work, so pilot records it as a *deferred candidate* and — if no other candidate is selectable — terminates with the new distinct, greppable `PILOT_VERDICT=DEFERRED_TO_LAND` line (registered in the `ralph.md` `/goal` driver grammar), never collapsing to `NO_WORK`. Closed-unmerged / missing-branch / merged-but-open-spec all-done states surface `NEEDS_HUMAN`.

### Notes
- Patch release — a behavior **fix** to the status projection, not a new capability. Boundaries hold: no new lifecycle phases, no change to merge mechanics (land still owns merging — this only constrains the *status write* to require merge evidence), no override of human board edits (the who-wins tiebreak is preserved), tracker stays a projection. Docs updated across `tracker-sync.md`, `teams.md`, the tracker-sync / work / pilot / land skill prose, the `references/{status-sync,github,adapter-interface}.md` notes, and the projection decision record; Codex mirror regenerated + audited; flow-next.dev ships the counterpart tracker-sync + land pass.

## [flow-next 2.1.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **`/flow-next:land` accepts a bot "reviewed-clean" SHA-named comment as the `silence` signal** (fn-65). The default `silence` review signal was satisfied by "an automated review of the current head + zero unresolved threads + patience window elapsed", but land detected automated reviews **only** via the formal reviews API. The Codex GitHub reviewer (`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`) files a formal review only when it has findings — on a **clean** pass it posts an issue comment instead (e.g. *"Codex Review: Didn't find any major issues. Reviewed commit: `<sha>`"*) that never reaches the reviews API. So an unattended land loop would NOT auto-merge a converged-clean PR whose only change since the last finding was approved-by-silence — exactly the state land exists to merge (it bit the fn-64 land of PR #176; a human merged on judgment).
  - **Comment-scan evidence source** (fn-65.1): when `land.reviewSignal == silence`, land additionally scans `issues/<n>/comments` for an automated-reviewer (`[bot]`-suffix or `land.automatedReviewers`) comment matching `land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` that names the **current head SHA**. SHA tokens are explicitly extracted (`[0-9a-fA-F]{7,40}`, ≥7 chars, non-empty) and prefix-matched against `HEAD_OID` — an empty extraction never spuriously passes, and a stale-SHA or no-SHA clean comment is ignored (conservative by design). A match only ever **sets** `AUTO_REVIEW_CURRENT=1` (never resets the reviews-API path); CI, unresolved-thread, and window gates are unchanged. Comment-driven satisfaction is observable: `AUTO_REVIEW_SOURCE=comment` + `AUTO_REVIEW_EVIDENCE` (author + matched SHA prefix) surface in `--dry-run` and the verdict report.
  - **`land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` config** (fn-65.1): new optional key, seeded with a **structured built-in ERE** (`(Didn'?t find any( major)? issues|No( major)? issues found).*Reviewed commit`) that requires BOTH the clean phrase AND the `Reviewed commit` marker — a bare "no issues" mention never satisfies the gate. Contract: `null`/missing (an unseeded older repo) → fall back to the built-in default; **explicit empty string `""` → comment scan DISABLED** (pure reviews-API behavior, the real off-switch); other value → used. Scoped to `silence` only — `approve` and `<login>` signals are unchanged. New regression coverage in `tests/test_land_config.py`.
  - **Docs**: `docs/flowctl.md` land config table (new `land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` row — default shown as the built-in ERE, empty-disables stated), land skill workflow + SKILL.md, Codex mirror regenerated; flow-next.dev `autonomous/land.mdx` (silence-signal row, automated-reviewer prose, Configuration table) + changelog ship the counterpart pass.

### Notes
- Patch release — additive, opt-in, backward-compatible: empty/unset `land.cleanReviewCommentPattern` with a non-Codex reviewer is today's behavior exactly. The change only lets land *see* a clean review it currently misses; it introduces no new merge authority — CI-green, zero-unresolved-threads, and window-elapsed gates are untouched, and a clean comment never bypasses an open thread or red check.

## [flow-next 2.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Dependency projection — tracker-sync projects `depends_on_epics` into tracker issue relations** (fn-64 / FLOW-14). Flow specs declare cross-spec dependencies locally via `depends_on_epics`, but that graph stayed **local-only** — the board showed independent issues even though Flow knew one blocked another (it bit us in SapienXT, where the relations had to be hand-added in Linear). On push/reconcile of a linked spec, each `depends_on_epics` edge between two **linked** specs now becomes a **blocked-by** relation between their issues — on **both** Linear and GitHub, idempotently, never clobbering a relation a human added by hand. The relations counterpart to body/status/comments sync: projection, not coordination — flow stays authoritative and the tracker is never a control plane for deps.
  - **Transport-blind hook** (fn-64.5): the new `projectDepRelations` hook (modelled on the one-way `projectReadiness` pull) resolves edges via `flowctl sync list-dep-relations`, then drives the normalized adapter relation pair — `setIssueRelation(issue, blockedBy)` / `listIssueRelations(issue)` (fn-64.2, [`references/adapter-interface.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/adapter-interface.md)). The skill code does **not** branch on Linear-vs-GitHub; only adapter fidelity differs. Self-edges are skipped with a warning; a dependency cycle is tolerated — each declared edge projects as an independent direct relation, with no graph traversal or transitive expansion.
  - **Linear adapter** (fn-64.3): native issue relations — MCP `save_issue` `blockedBy`/`blocks` where the pinned schema exposes them, else the GraphQL `issueRelationCreate` rung (`type: blocks`, operands swapped), else a `noop` receipt. Idempotency via read-before-write across **both** `relations` AND `inverseRelations`, each canonicalized to one direction.
  - **GitHub adapter** (fn-64.4): native issue **dependencies** (GA Aug 2025) via the REST `…/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocked_by` endpoints where the repo/account has them (feature-detected with a `GET` probe; the numeric DB id, not `#N`; native POST uses `gh api -F` for the numeric `issue_id`, never `-f`), else a provenance-fenced **"Blocked by" body block** (`<!-- flow:deps -->`…`<!-- /flow:deps -->` list of `#N` references) — the same reduced-fidelity posture the adapter takes for status.
  - **Provenance ledger + never-clobber** (fn-64.1): neither platform stores relation authorship, so tracker-sync records the edges it created in a per-spec `depRelations` ledger (the `.flow/specs/<id>.json` sidecar, atomic write — entry shape `{key, dep_spec, from_tracker_id, to_tracker_id, type, source, updatedAt}`, where `key` is an opaque hash of the directed pair, never a raw issue key inline). A relation **not** in the ledger (native) / **outside** the fenced block (GitHub fallback) is **never removed**. New flowctl plumbing: `flowctl sync list-dep-relations` / `set-dep-relation` / `clear-dep-relation`, plus the identifier validator widened to accept a bare numeric `N` (so `set-tracker-id --identifier 42` no longer fails before any adapter runs).
  - **Body-merge ownership + collision rule** (fn-64.5, [`references/body-merge.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/body-merge.md)): the GitHub `<!-- flow:deps -->` block is flow-owned — the canonical `trackerBodyForMerge` transform strips it before every hash / merge-base / divergence comparison, so flow's own dependency block never round-trips into the spec or registers as phantom tracker divergence. The collision case (a ledgered edge still in `depends_on_epics` but **missing remotely** — a tracker user removed it) is evaluated **before** per-side rules and emits `sync defer` + a `queued` receipt rather than silently recreating it.
  - **Completed-blocker rule**: a dependency whose **local** dep spec is `done` stays **visible** as a completed blocker on the board but does **NOT** feed back into Flow `ready=true` gating (readiness already treats done deps as satisfied — this hook must not regress that). `dep_status` is the *local* dep-spec status, never a remote fetch.
  - **Tests + docs** (fn-64.6): pure-stdlib `unittest` coverage in `tests/test_tracker_sync_state.py` (dep-relation add, idempotent rerun, missing-link warning, completed-blocker status, self-edge skip, bare-`N` identifier acceptance, fresh-spec sidecar field) plus the body-merge exclusion fixture. Docs: [`tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md#dependency-projection--depends_on_epics--tracker-issue-relations) (new Dependency-projection section), [`flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md#sync) (new subcommands), the adapter references, `GLOSSARY.md` (dependency projection, provenance ledger, completed-blocker rule).

### Notes
- This is the relations edge type the bridge was missing — body, status, and comments already synced two-way. Boundaries hold: no tracker→flow dep ingestion, no transitive/graph expansion, no readiness-model changes, GitHub Projects fields out of scope. Codex mirror regenerated and audited (no spurious ask-block injections, validators green). flow-next.dev ships the counterpart tracker-sync page + changelog + `FLOW_NEXT_VERSION` → 2.1.0 in the same workstream.

## [flow-next 2.0.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Optional HTML artifact mode — spec & PR render lenses** (fn-62 / FLOW-12). When activated, the lifecycle skills that own the human touchpoints emit beautifully rendered, self-contained HTML pages *alongside* their markdown output: a **render lens** is a regenerable review artifact derived from a markdown source of truth — never the storage format, never parsed back as state. Markdown (and tracker-sync) stays 100% the record; users who stick with default markdown see **zero change** (no reference file loads, no artifacts are written, no new steps, zero token cost).
  - **Activation** (fn-62.1): `flowctl config set artifacts.html.enabled true` — seeded in flowctl config defaults (`false`, so `config get` returns a value, not null, on fresh repos; `tests/test_artifacts_config.py`). `/flow-next:setup` asks once (include-only-if-unset, like every ceremony question) and on opt-in offers the optional `lavish-axi` install with its session-spanning feedback model. Artifacts live at fixed deterministic paths — `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/spec.html` / `pr.html`, never timestamped (Lavish keys annotation sessions on the absolute file path) — committed by default so PR blob links resolve, or gitignored per project (setup offers the choice; link strategy follows `git check-ignore`).
  - **Shared disclosure reference** (fn-62.2): one progressively disclosed file, [`references/html-artifacts.md`](plugins/flow-next/references/html-artifacts.md), loaded by participating skills only when the mode is on. Carries all generation rules plus an explicit anti-slop design contract (own instrument-panel palette/typography, no CDN fonts, zero external requests, print-friendly, staleness stamp in every footer, layered CSS-grid DAG rendering — never hand-typed SVG coordinates). Generation is agentic (the host agent reads the reference); flowctl's only contribution is the config knob.
  - **Spec artifact** (fn-62.3): ONE generation pathway with state-dependent rendering — spec-only business-review view before tasks exist (`/flow-next:capture` §5.10), the added plan layer (task dependency DAG with critical path, R-ID → task coverage matrix) once tasks exist (`/flow-next:plan` Step 8.5, after the refinement loop exits). The spec markdown links its lens via an idempotent marker line (replaced in place, never duplicated).
  - **PR artifact** (fn-62.4): `/flow-next:make-pr` Phase 1.5 emits a **read-only review instrument** — diff-derived (never from commit messages), verified against the spec's R-ID export before publishing (mismatches render as visibly flagged rows; warn-in-artifact, never blocking), churn grouped by review intent, where-to-look checklist. Committed narrowly (`chore(flow): pr artifact <spec-id>`, artifact file only — never `git add -A`); `--dry-run` writes no artifact; generation failure is non-fatal and the Ralph stdout contract (`PR_URL=` only) is untouched.
  - **Lavish integration (optional, detect-on-PATH — never wrapped, bundled, or required)** : with `lavish-axi` on PATH in an interactive session, spec artifacts open as annotation sessions; feedback is pull-only and session-spanning (queues in `~/.lavish-axi/state.json`, survives agent death, any later session drains it via `lavish-axi poll`), and every annotation maps to a markdown-source edit followed by lens regeneration. The PR artifact never enters the annotate loop; autonomous/Ralph contexts never open a session and never poll. Absence or server idle-stop is invisible — the artifact is a self-contained static page.
  - **Docs** (fn-62.5): new [`docs/html-artifacts.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/html-artifacts.md) reference (GitHub-display limitation + local-open guidance included), README / teams / ralph / GLOSSARY surfaces.

### Removed
- **BREAKING: the `planSync.crossEpic` config alias is gone** (deprecated since 1.1.3; removal promised for 2.0 throughout the 1.x line). `flowctl` no longer reads, writes, or migrates the legacy key: reading `planSync.crossSpec` never falls back to a leftover `crossEpic` value, `config get/set planSync.crossEpic` is now a plain unknown-key lookup (no redirect, no deprecation warning), and `flowctl init` no longer mirrors legacy → canonical. A leftover `crossEpic` key in `.flow/config.json` is inert (preserved by the config merge, never read). **Migration:** if you still rely on it, set the canonical key once — `flowctl config set planSync.crossSpec true`. Regression suites converted to pin the removal (`tests/test_config_alias.py`, `tests/test_init_crossspec_mirror.py`); prose surfaces (setup workflow, `docs/flowctl.md`, plan-sync agent, local-dev smoke) updated to match.

### Notes
- 2.0.0 marks the leap, not an unrelated rewrite: the HTML artifact mode is fully opt-in (OFF by default — markdown-only users see zero new steps, prerequisites, or token overhead), and the only breaking change is the long-promised crossEpic alias removal above. Codex mirror regenerated and audited (references/ copy byte-identical, no spurious ask-block injections, validators green). flow-next.dev shipped the counterpart pass in the same workstream: visual-aids + pipeline pages, landing/SPECS/TEAMS/REVIEW surfaces, docs-site changelog + `FLOW_NEXT_VERSION` → 2.0.0.

## [flow-next 1.14.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **`/flow-next:land` — the ship loop: a cadence-tick autonomous PR babysitter** (fn-60 / FLOW-9). Where pilot and Ralph deliberately stop at a draft PR, land takes those PRs the rest of the way — fully autonomously, opt-in, `/loop`-shaped (`/loop 30m /flow-next:land`). One invocation is one tick: DISCOVER the open PRs the build loop authored (spec `branch_name` match AND the make-pr breadcrumb in the PR body — BOTH signals required before any mutation; branch-only matches are `NEEDS_HUMAN`, never acted on; only specs with ALL tasks done qualify — the pilot-concurrency interlock), GATE each PR read-only (durable-label skip → CI tri-state over ALL checks via `gh pr checks --json bucket`, never `--required`; empty check list inside the window = pending, never success → patience window anchored to the LAST PUSH, default 30 min → unresolved review threads → review signal → stale-approval-dismissal loop detection → `mergeStateStatus`), ACT with at most ONE action class per PR (bounded CI fix with strikes in `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/flow-next/land-strikes.json` and a durable `flow-next:needs-human` label on exhaustion; resolve-pr dispatch with `mode:autonomous`; mechanical rebase only for DIRTY/BEHIND — any conflict hunk aborts to `BLOCKED`; or the gated merge: `gh pr ready` flip + explicit `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch --match-head-commit`, NEVER `--auto`, then the post-merge tail `flowctl spec close` → opt-in `tracker.perEvent.land.merged` touchpoint → release-follow of the project's own release docs with an idempotency probe, or stop at merge), then REPORT per-PR evidence blocks and one terminal machine-greppable line: `LAND_VERDICT=<MERGED|RELEASED|FIXING_CI|AWAITING_REVIEW|RESOLVING|BLOCKED|NEEDS_HUMAN|NO_WORK> prs=<n> pr=<deciding-pr-url|-> reason="<one line>"` (worst-severity rule). Review convergence is configurable via `land.reviewSignal`: `silence` (default — an automated review present + zero unresolved threads + the window elapsed; bot reviewers like Codex never file formal APPROVEs), `approve` (formal `reviewDecision`), or a named reviewer login; with no automated review ever and no signal configured it never merges unreviewed (`NEEDS_HUMAN`). A merged-but-unclosed spec re-enters idempotently (resume close → tracker → release, never a second merge). `--dry-run` reports the full per-PR gate classification with zero mutations. Branch hygiene throughout: dirty-tree refusal at tick start, per-PR checkout restore + clean-tree assertion, Ralph-nesting refusal (`FLOW_RALPH` / `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`). gh surfaces verified against gh 2.93.0.
- **`land.*` config surface with seeded defaults** (fn-60.2): `land.release` (`true`), `land.patienceMinutes` (`30`), `land.reviewSignal` (`silence`), `land.automatedReviewers` (`""` — csv allowlist supplementing the `[bot]`-suffix rule), `land.ciFixBudget` (`3`). Seeded in flowctl config defaults so `config get` returns values, not null, on fresh repos. New regression suite `tests/test_land_config.py`.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:resolve-pr` gained an autonomous mode** (fn-60.2, fn-59.2 signal convention): the `mode:autonomous` arg token (primary) or `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` env (secondary) suppresses question branches only — never Ralph paths. Under autonomy the Phase-10 needs-human surface emits `NEEDS_HUMAN:` report lines instead of blocking, threads stay open, and the run ends with the machine-readable terminal line `RESOLVE_PR_VERDICT=<RESOLVED|PENDING|NEEDS_HUMAN> threads=<n> fixed=<n> needs_human=<n>` that land gates on. Bounded 2 fix-verify cycles unchanged. Its "user-triggered only" Forbidden line carries one confined exception: land may dispatch it with `mode:autonomous`.
- **The standing "no `gh pr merge` from skills" rule now has exactly one confined exception** — land merges explicitly after its full gate tree passes; every other skill keeps the no-auto-merge rule (CLAUDE.md exception note included).

### Notes
- Land and Ralph are alternative autonomous drivers, never nested. Land is the pipeline terminus: with pilot (build loop) and land (ship loop) the lifecycle closes end to end — bless a spec → plan → review → work → draft PR → CI → reviews → merge → release. Codex mirror regenerated with the new land skill. Docs touched: README (count/row/third autonomous path), GLOSSARY Land term + Verdict extension, CLAUDE.md merge-rule exception, docs index, `ralph.md` ship-loop recipe; flow-next.dev counterpart page: `/autonomous/land`.

## [flow-next 1.13.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **`/flow-next:pilot` — a single-tick autonomous build-loop conductor** (fn-59 / FLOW-8). One invocation is one tick: SELECT the first `open` + `ready` spec whose `depends_on_epics` are done and whose tasks carry no other-actor claims, ACT by dispatching exactly one stage skill, VERIFY advancement from `flowctl` state (or a gh-confirmed OPEN PR URL for make-pr, which has no flowctl transition), then REPORT with one terminal machine-greppable line: `PILOT_VERDICT=<ADVANCED|NO_WORK|BLOCKED|NEEDS_HUMAN> spec=<id> stage=<stage> reason="<one line>"`. Stages are exactly `plan` / `plan-review` / `work` / `make-pr`; selection is a two-pass walk over the fn-58 `ready` gate with dependency + collision checks; branch handling follows the spec branch matrix (checkout existing branch for work/make-pr, `--branch=new` on first work tick, `NEEDS_HUMAN` for inconsistent all-done/no-branch state). The don't-thrash guard records healthy no-advance ticks in `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/flow-next/pilot-strikes.json`, clears the spec's `ready` flag via `flowctl spec unready` on strike 2/2, and clears strikes when a human re-blesses via `flowctl spec ready`. V1 args are intentionally small: bare `/flow-next:pilot`, `--spec <id>`, `--dry-run`, and passthroughs `--review=<backend>`, `--research=<grep|rp>`, `--depth=<level>` (defaults: configured backend, grep, short). Driver recipes are host-owned, not tick-owned: Claude Code `/loop` v2.1.72+ (`/loop 10m /flow-next:pilot`, loops expire after 7 days), Claude Code `/goal` v2.1.139+ (`/goal keep running /flow-next:pilot until it prints PILOT_VERDICT=NO_WORK, or stop after 20 turns`), and Codex `/goal` with `[features] goals = true`, CLI >= 0.128.0, and a plain-text objective naming pilot + the verdict grammar.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:plan`, `/flow-next:work`, and `/flow-next:make-pr` now honor autonomous mode without entering Ralph** (fn-59.2). The primary signal is the `mode:autonomous` arg token, which survives skill-invokes-skill; the secondary signal is `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` for process-level drivers. These signals suppress user-question branches only — they deliberately do **not** activate ralph-guard hooks, receipt choreography, or any `FLOW_RALPH` path. Under autonomy, work defaults to `--branch=new`, make-pr forces a draft PR and hard-errors instead of prompting, and genuinely ambiguous states surface to pilot as `NEEDS_HUMAN`.

### Notes
- Ralph and pilot are alternative drivers, never nested: pilot refuses under `FLOW_RALPH` / `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`. Ralph remains the overnight shell harness with fresh sessions, receipts, and ralph-guard; pilot is the in-session single tick with transcript verdicts. The `rp` review backend still needs the RepoPrompt GUI, so unattended runs should use `--review=codex`, `--review=copilot`, or `--review=none`. Codex mirror regenerated with the new pilot skill (`openai.yaml` included). Docs touched: README, GLOSSARY Pilot / Verdict terms, `ralph.md` host-driven-vs-Ralph contrast, docs index; flow-next.dev counterpart page: `/skills/pilot`.

## [flow-next 1.12.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Spec readiness signal — a human-owned `ready` flag, the entry gate for autonomous execution** (fn-58 / FLOW-7). A spec now carries a `ready` boolean (default `false`) marking it "complete enough to hand to an agent" — orthogonal to `status` (`open|done`; a ready spec stays `open` through planning and work), human-owned or tracker-projected, **never agent-inferred**. The gate is strictly opt-in: non-adopters see no prompts, warnings, or badge noise anywhere.
  - **`flowctl spec ready <id>` / `spec unready <id>`** — idempotent toggles (no write, no `updated_at` bump when the flag already matches; `"changed"` reported in `--json`). The on-disk flag is **lazy**: the sidecar carries `ready` only after a toggle actually changes state (`spec create` never writes it; absent reads `false`) — zero working-tree churn for non-adopters. Every JSON read surface (`show`, `specs`, `list`) emits an explicit `"ready": <bool>`, and ready specs get a `[ready]` badge in `specs`/`list` output (badge only when set — no draft-noise). Task ids rejected; `done` specs allowed; `epic ready`/`epic unready` aliases included. New regression suite `tests/test_spec_ready.py` (lazy purity, idempotency, badge/JSON surfaces) wired into CI + both smoke scripts.
  - **Tracker projection (`tracker.readyState`)** — for tracker-connected repos, the `/flow-next:tracker-sync` discovery ceremony asks one optional, skippable question: *which tracker workflow state means "ready for work"?* (Linear: a workflow-state **name**, matched case-insensitive/trimmed — names, not `state.type`, since a custom "Ready" state is typically `type=unstarted`; GitHub: a **label**, pre-created idempotently — present ⇒ ready, absent ⇒ not ready, a normal state). Every pull-side sync (`pull`/`reconcile`) projects the state onto the local `ready` flag — **one-way, tracker → local, tracker authoritative** (a local `spec ready` is overwritten on the next sync). Change-only event-tagged receipts (silent on echo); a stale/renamed configured state warns + `noop` receipt + flag untouched + the sync continues. `readyState` lives at the tracker top level (sibling of `conflictTiebreak`); `null` = projection off.
  - **Adoption-gated prompting layer** — the same in-use gate (≥1 ready spec OR `tracker.readyState` configured) governs every new prompt, so non-adopters see zero new questions. `/flow-next:capture` and `/flow-next:refine` offer an optional end-of-authoring "Mark ready?" consent (default **keep-draft**; gated OFF when `readyState` is configured — never invite a local edit the next sync would revert; autofix never writes readiness). `/flow-next:plan` soft-checks readiness before the scout fan-out: not-ready + adopted ⇒ one warn-not-block question (default **proceed** — planning is non-destructive), with the option set split by mode (local: proceed / mark-ready-then-proceed / abort; tracker-authoritative: proceed / abort / update-tracker-state-then-rerun — local mark-ready never offered). Non-interactive/Ralph auto-proceeds with one stderr line. `capture --rewrite` resets `ready` → `false` (a full re-authoring re-opens the blessing) and announces the reset only when it actually changed the flag; interview refinement **never** auto-resets.

### Notes
- Readiness is the shared entry gate for the forthcoming build-loop specs (fn-59/fn-60) but stands alone as backlog hygiene — knowing which specs are blessed vs still-draft. No new `status` value; no `--ready` filter flag in v1 (`specs --json` + jq covers selection); readiness is pull-only for tracker users (no outbound push). Both `flowctl.py` copies (canonical `scripts/` + dogfood `.flow/bin/`) updated in lockstep. Codex mirror regenerated (the three net-new ask sites — capture/interview mark-ready, plan soft-check, ceremony readiness question — verified transformed to plain-text numbered prompts). Docs: GLOSSARY "Ready" term, [`architecture.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/architecture.md) (lazy spec-JSON field), [`flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md) (`spec ready`/`unready`, `tracker.readyState`, alias rows), [`tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md#readiness-projection--trackerreadystate--local-ready-flag) (readiness projection), setup `usage.md`.

## [flow-next 1.11.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Tracker-sync lifecycle hooks are now observable and forcing** (fn-57 / FLOW-10). The bridge's lifecycle touchpoints (claim → In-Progress, done → comment, PR → issue link) were prose obligations an agent could silently skip — reproduced on two hosts (a Claude session and a Codex session in another project): PRs landed unlinked, issues never moved, and nothing failed. The hardening lives in the shared receipt/lifecycle layer, so it applies uniformly to **every adapter** (Linear, GitHub, future trackers) — and flowctl gains **no tracker-mutation code**: all mutations stay agent-driven through the tracker-sync skill; the deterministic additions are read-only.
  - **`flowctl sync receipt --event <perEvent-key>`** — every lifecycle dispatch's receipt now records which touchpoint it served (`work.firstClaim`, `work.done`, `capture`, `makePr`, …). Free-form (the perEvent key set is an open extension point); pre-flag receipts carry `event: null` and never satisfy an event-specific check. Every receipt call site in the tracker-sync skill is tagged via the caller's `event:` token (parsed in steps.md Phase 0); manual runs stay legitimately untagged.
  - **`flowctl sync check <spec-id> --events <csv> --since <iso> [--json]`** — the first *reader* of `.flow/sync-runs/`: a read-only, local-only audit reporting `OK:<event>` / `MISSING:<event>` per triggered touchpoint. MISSING iff the event triggered this run AND its `tracker.perEvent` leaf is enabled AND the bridge is active AND no receipt with a matching `event` tag and `timestamp ≥ --since` exists. Any receipt status clears (the check asserts the touchpoint *ran*); linkage is NOT a precondition (a never-linked spec that should have create-if-unlinked'd is exactly the miss it catches). **Zero overhead for non-tracker repos:** bridge inactive → silent constant-time exit 0 before any IO. Exit 0 always — output drives agent action, not the exit code.
- **`/flow-next:prime` seeds GLOSSARY.md from the repo** (fn-57 Package B, R10). When the glossary is absent or a husk (`glossary list --json` `total_terms == 0` — never a file-presence check), a new Phase 5.5 scans the repo for load-bearing vocabulary, proposes ~10-20 evidence-backed terms (file refs mandatory, `_Avoid_` aliases on visible naming drift), and writes via `flowctl glossary add` **only after read-back approval** (`--fix-all` does not bypass it). A populated glossary gets a coverage report line and is never rewritten — pruning stays with `/flow-next:audit`.
- **`/flow-next:capture` joins interview as a glossary writer** (R11). Capture's synthesis now runs a husk-aware new-vocabulary scan (workflow §2.7), offers genuinely-new project terms at read-back with a consent question, and writes approved terms via `flowctl glossary add` (§5.8) — autofix prints suggestions, never writes.
- **The glossary read path widens to where wrong-concept errors get built** (R12): `repo-scout` / `context-scout` gain a Step 0.5 that surfaces only request-matched glossary entries (max 5, budget-capped — never the whole file), the work worker's re-anchor reads task-relevant terms, and impl-review (RP) + plan-review prompts add a Vocabulary criterion conditional on `total_terms > 0`. Every gate is `total_terms == 0 → silent skip` — zero behavior change without a populated glossary.
- **New docs page: [`docs/self-improving.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/self-improving.md)** (R13) — the surfaces that compound through normal use (memory, glossary, decision records, strategy drift surfacing), with the flow-next.dev counterpart at `/strategy/self-improving`.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:work`, `/flow-next:capture`, and `/flow-next:make-pr` end every run with a tracker-sync check + bounded retro-fire** (R2). Each skill runs `sync check` independently of the touchpoints (so a wholesale-skipped dispatch block is still caught), using an on-disk `--since` anchor (work → earliest `claimed_at` this run; capture → the spec's `created_at`; make-pr → the PR's `createdAt`) and a triggered-set `--events` contract (configured-but-not-triggered events are never MISSING). Any `MISSING:<event>` is retro-fired **exactly once** via the tracker-sync skill, re-checked against a fresh `--since`, and the final summary carries a **mandatory four-state `Tracker sync:` slot** — `OK` | `MISSING:<event> → retro-fired → OK` | `MISSING:<event> (retro-fire failed: <reason>)` | `n/a (bridge inactive)`. An explicit `n/a` proves the check ran; still-MISSING after one cycle is a recorded, visible outcome — never a block (best-effort discipline unchanged). Under Ralph, check + summary lines route to stderr (make-pr's stdout stays the single `PR_URL=` line; work's stdout stays clean for harness parsing). Manual recovery guidance (read the receipt note, re-fire via `/flow-next:tracker-sync` once transport returns) documented in [`tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md#missing-after-retro-fire--recovery).
- **`/flow-next:make-pr` §4.6b — deterministic post-create PR↔issue ref verify/repair** (R4). §4.6a appends the non-closing `Ref <identifier>` line to the *local* body file before create — but an agent that hand-rolls `gh pr create` (the observed execution-fidelity gap) bypasses it. make-pr now verifies against the **LIVE** PR body (`gh pr view --json body`, never `$BODY_FILE`) with the same whole-line `grep -qixF` matcher as §4.6a, and repairs append-only via `gh pr edit --body-file -` when absent (65,536-char cap re-checked). Idempotent and fully non-fatal — the PR is already open.
- **flow-next.dev hero pillar grid redesigned to six pillars** including the new "Self-improving / Compounds as you work." (R15) — an extensible 3-column auto-wrapping capability index, plus STRATEGY.md's new "Self-improving through normal work" track (R14).

### Fixed
- **[`linear-mcp.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/references/linear-mcp.md) UUID correction** (R9): the claude.ai Linear MCP returns *identifiers* (`WOR-17`), never UUIDs — on create AND fetch (verified live 2026-06-09) — so first-link requires the GraphQL rung (`LINEAR_API_KEY`) to obtain the UUID for `sync set-tracker-id`. The previous prose implied the MCP rung could complete a first link on its own.

### Notes
- Codex mirror regenerated (the work-phases §3c splice in `sync-codex.sh` now also carries the worker's glossary re-anchor line). New regression suites: `tests/test_sync_check.py` (19 tests — R8 silent inactive exit, MISSING predicate, any-status-clears, null-event back-compat, exit-0-always) and `--event` coverage in `tests/test_tracker_receipts.py`; both wired into CI as explicit steps. Both `flowctl.py` copies (canonical `scripts/` + dogfood `.flow/bin/`) updated in lockstep (byte-identical invariant held). Docs: [`tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md) (observable+forcing lifecycle, MISSING-recovery), [`flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md#sync) (`sync check`, `--event`), setup `usage.md` examples.

## [flow-next 1.10.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Plugin homepage now points at the canonical product site `https://flow-next.dev`** instead of the stale `https://mickel.tech/apps/flow-next`. The `homepage` field in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugins/flow-next/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `plugins/flow-next/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (plus the Codex manifest's `interface.websiteURL`) all carried the old URL; `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` was already correct, so the rest were just drift. `author.url` / `owner.url` (Gordon's personal site / GitHub) are unchanged. Also aligned the `flow-next-tui` package `homepage` and the README "Visual overview" doc row (which redundantly listed both URLs) to `flow-next.dev`.

## [flow-next 1.10.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **`flowctl copilot impl-review` no longer crashes with `UnicodeDecodeError` on a repo containing a non-UTF-8 source subtree** (#167 — the read-side counterpart to #123). `find_references()` (the symbol-cross-reference collector behind `gather_context_hints`) ran `git grep` over a fixed, broad extension set (`*.c *.h *.cpp *.cs *.java *.py …`) and decoded the hits with a hard `text=True, encoding="utf-8"` and **no `errors=`**. Because `gather_context_hints` extracts symbols from the *changed* files and greps each one **repo-wide**, a single legacy file anywhere in the tree — e.g. a German cp1252 C/C++ subtree carrying `0xfc` ü / `0xe4` ä / `0xf6` ö / `0xdf` ß — was enough to abort context gathering, *even when every file you actively edit is UTF-8*. The collector now captures `git grep` output as **bytes** and decodes defensively (`result.stdout.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")`), matching the byte-then-decode pattern the diff readers already use. Behavior is unchanged for valid UTF-8 repos. Reported with measured data by VGottselig (a large Windows CAD codebase: 304 of ~5400 C/C++ files non-UTF-8).
- **`flowctl` forces its own stdout/stderr to UTF-8 at startup, so non-ASCII output (`→`, umlauts) no longer aborts on a legacy console codepage** such as Windows cp1252 (`UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '→'`, e.g. from `copilot plan-review`'s `print(output)`) (#167). `main()` now calls `sys.stdout/stderr.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")` first thing, guarded so a captured or already-detached stream is left untouched. This removes the need for the `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` workaround.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:work` Verify-Completion (phase 3d) now carries a recovery heuristic for a lost/errored worker result** (#167). When the host (Agent-tool) drops a long-running worker's completion report (`[Tool result missing due to internal error]`) — its *work* may be complete even though the report never arrived — the loop no longer blocks waiting for a result that will never come. It diagnoses from ground truth (`flowctl show` + `git log` + `git status`) and classifies: **already done** → proceed to plan-sync; **code present but not finalized** → spawn a re-anchoring continuation worker that resumes from the late phase (build → review → `flowctl done`) instead of restarting; **nothing landed** → retry normally. Skill prose only; Codex mirror regenerated.

### Notes
- Both `flowctl.py` copies (canonical `scripts/` + dogfood `.flow/bin/`) updated in lockstep (byte-identical invariant held). New regression suite: `tests/test_cp1252_robustness.py` (reproduces the cp1252 `find_references` crash against a staged non-UTF-8 fixture; locks the stdio reconfigure guard and the phase-3d recovery prose, canonical + Codex mirror).

## [flow-next 1.10.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Eval-driven prompt optimization — 8 scout/analyst agents made ~40–71% leaner per call, with accuracy held** (fn-54 / FLOW-5). Rolled the external "autoresearch" eval loop (baseline → one mutation → keep-if-better ratchet; methodology in [`agent_docs/optimizing-skills.md`](agent_docs/optimizing-skills.md)) across the read-only agents whose free-form output flows into the planner / work-loop context. Each gained a **feature-preserving output budget** — the reductions are at *runtime* (the rendered output), not in prompt size:
  - [`repo-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/repo-scout.md) (83→100% on its eval set, ~40–50% leaner) · [`context-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/context-scout.md) (60→93%, ~60–70%, dropped the prescribed Code-Signatures block) · [`flow-gap-analyst`](plugins/flow-next/agents/flow-gap-analyst.md) (~50–70%, 26/27 gaps held) · [`quality-auditor`](plugins/flow-next/agents/quality-auditor.md) (~63%) · [`spec-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/spec-scout.md) (No-Relationship → count, scale-robust) · [`docs-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/docs-scout.md) (~48–69%) · [`github-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/github-scout.md) (~71%, the biggest) · [`practice-scout`](plugins/flow-next/agents/practice-scout.md) (~52%).
  - **Feature-preservation is the guarantee, not a hope.** Every mutation was kept only if a per-target coverage/accuracy eval held (the ratchet): grounding (`context-scout` cited paths `test -f`-verified vs `~/work/DocIQ-Sphere`), findings (`quality-auditor` vs the `~/work/slop-testbed` 7-issue corpus — Major bug + all slop still caught, clean stays ✅), gaps (per-input answer keys), and docs/APIs/gotchas (the "pointer-not-paste" rule: name the API inline, drop code blocks, the link carries depth). The leaner research scouts even surfaced *extra* real issues a verbose baseline missed (a current CVE; an extra trust-proxy gotcha).
  - **End-to-end verified:** the optimized scouts → a planner produced a correct, ship-quality build plan for a deliberately hard, cross-cutting DocIQ-Sphere feature (org-scoped agent-run rate limiting) reading *only* the budgeted scout output — features preserved at the *consumer* level, not just scout-output level.
- **`/flow-next:make-pr`: removed stale `fn-42.N` build-scaffolding archaeology** from the skill prompt (heading labels, a phase-reference table column, two orphaned sentences) — render output behaviorally identical; no guardrail / routing / tracker-sync logic touched.

### Notes
- **`/flow-next:capture` is unchanged.** A trim was tried and **reverted** — it regressed business-context routing on one input (the ratchet caught it). The capture override guard (refuses to silently overwrite a user-edited spec) was verified intact.
- No `flowctl` / Python logic changed — prompt markdown only. Each agent edit was re-mirrored to its Codex copy via `sync-codex.sh`. Retained eval harnesses (frozen inputs, evals, baselines, per-experiment changelogs) under `optimization/`.

## [flow-next 1.9.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:setup` now detects Cursor and writes Cursor-correct project instructions, instead of mis-detecting it as Codex.** Setup's platform detection keyed only on plugin-root env vars (`DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` → Droid, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` → Claude Code, **else → Codex**). Cursor exposes *neither*, so a Cursor local install fell into the Codex branch — `/flow-next:setup` wrote the `$flow-next-plan` Codex command syntax into AGENTS.md and ran `.codex/` agent + hook setup, while the installer advertises Cursor usage as `/flow-next:*`. Setup now adds a **`CURSOR_AGENT` + `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest** branch (ordered before the `else → codex` fallback) → `PLATFORM=cursor`, applied at **every** platform-branch point in the workflow (detection, the 6b docs-status template, the Step 6 Docs question, and the Step 7 write mapping), which: writes the `/flow-next:plan` slash-command snippet (Cursor runs the same commands; lands in AGENTS.md, which Cursor reads), resolves `flowctl` via `.flow/bin/flowctl`, reads the version from `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and **skips** the Codex-only `.codex/` agent/hook copy. The detection requires **both** the env var and the Cursor manifest because `CURSOR_AGENT` is **inherited by child processes** — so Codex launched *from* a Cursor shell inherits it; the manifest (present only in a real `~/.cursor/plugins/local/flow-next` install) plus a **`! -d ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/codex`** guard (a real Cursor install excludes the `codex/` mirror, so its absence rejects the shared repo source tree where all manifests coexist) keep a Codex-hosted-in-Cursor run — whether installed or run from source — correctly classified as `codex`. For that `codex/`-absence proof to hold on re-install, the installers now produce a **true mirror**: `install-cursor.sh` adds `rsync --delete-excluded` and `install-cursor.ps1` explicitly `Remove-Item`s the excluded dirs after `robocopy /MIR` (plain `--delete` / `/MIR` + `/XD` leave a pre-existing `codex/` in place); `test_install_cursor_parity.py` locks both. Surfaced + hardened across five rounds of PR #162/#163 review. Codex mirror regenerated.
- **Tracker-sync create-if-unlinked now snapshots the merge base at issue-create time, even when the triggering op is `comment`.** When the first lifecycle touchpoint for an unlinked spec was a `comment` op (e.g. `work.done` / `makePr` with earlier events disabled), the auto-create path created the issue and attached the tracker id but did **not** call `sync set-merge-base` / `set-last-synced` — and the `comment` path itself leaves body/status untouched, so the linked issue had **no merge base**. A later body sync would then hit the no-base bootstrap, treat the sync as a fast-forward projection, and could silently **overwrite tracker-side edits** made after the issue was created. The flow-first auto-link now snapshots the just-rendered pair (`set-merge-base` BOTH halves + `set-last-synced`) at create time — the issue body we just wrote *is* the `renderFlowToTracker` output, so the base is exact. (`push`-first auto-link was already covered by the `push` skeleton's post-write snapshot; this makes the `comment`/`reconcile`-first paths match.) Surfaced in PR #162 review. Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 1.9.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Cursor local-plugin install support — `./scripts/install-cursor.sh` (macOS/Linux) + `install-cursor.ps1` (Windows).** Cursor ships its own plugin namespace (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`) and does **not** read Claude Code plugins the way Grok Build does, so flow-next now carries a Cursor-native manifest plus a one-shot installer on **both** platform families. The bash script `rsync`s `plugins/flow-next/` into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/flow-next`; the PowerShell sibling uses `robocopy /MIR` to the same dest (`%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\plugins\local\flow-next`). Both install a **real directory** (Cursor's plugin loader rejects symlinks that escape `~/.cursor`), exclude the Codex mirror / tests / `__pycache__` / `*.pyc` / `.DS_Store`, are idempotent (re-run to update), and print next steps. Verified end-to-end: skills, commands, and **multi-agent scout fan-out** all work; `flowctl` resolves via `.flow/bin/flowctl` — **every skill preamble now carries a `[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"` fallback** (the same pattern fn-50.3 added to qa/prime), so on Cursor (where neither `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` nor `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set) the advertised resolution is literally true rather than relying on the agent ignoring a broken `FLOWCTL=` expansion; the env-var-present path (Claude Code / Codex / Droid) short-circuits on `[ -x ]` and is byte-identical. New manifest: [`plugins/flow-next/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`](plugins/flow-next/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) (`commands` path-override points at the nested `./commands/flow-next` dir). A `test_install_cursor_parity.py` drift guard hard-asserts the two installers keep the same dest, exclude set, and real-dir (no-symlink) contract, and the `flow-next` CI matrix now **runs each installer for real** on its native OS (`install-cursor.sh` on ubuntu/macos, `install-cursor.ps1` on windows-latest) and verifies the result against the source tree via `scripts/ci/verify_cursor_install.py` (component trees match 1:1; `codex/` / `tests/` / `*.pyc` excluded).
  - **Documented caveats** (cosmetic + one hard limit): no plugin card in Cursor's plugin list and slash-menu autocomplete under-lists `flow-next:*` skills (both cosmetic — commands run when typed), and **Ralph autonomous mode is unsupported** — Cursor's hook schema (`afterFileEdit` / `beforeShellExecution`) doesn't map to Claude's `PreToolUse` + `Bash|Execute` matchers the Ralph guard relies on. Full matrix + caveats in [`docs/platforms.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/platforms.md#cursor-local-plugin); README status table updated.

### Fixed
- **Tracker-sync: a lifecycle event on an *unlinked* spec now flow-first-pushes (create issue + link) before reconciling/commenting, instead of silently no-opping.** When the bridge was active and a user started a spec with `/flow-next:plan` (or any lifecycle touchpoint) on a spec that had no `tracker.id`, the touchpoint no-op'd — so the issue was never created and the spec stayed orphaned from the tracker. Only `capture` flow-first-pushed; everything else (`plan` / `interview` / `work.*` / `makePr` / `resolvePr` / `completionReview`) skipped. Observed dogfooding in both Cursor and Codex: `/flow-next:plan` produced a local spec with no Linear issue. Fixed with a single **create-if-unlinked** rule in the [`flow-next-tracker-sync`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-tracker-sync/steps.md) skill (Phase 3): any `push` / `reconcile` / `comment` routed for an unlinked spec runs the flow-first link first (`renderFlowToTracker` → create issue → `sync set-tracker-id`), then proceeds. `unlink` remains the only operation that no-ops on an unlinked spec. Every lifecycle touchpoint's prose updated to match (`plan` / `work` / `interview` / `make-pr` / `resolve-pr` + [`tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md)); a touchpoint now no-ops **only** when no transport is reachable. The skill's Phase 0 operation parser now also recognizes the `comment` token (the op `work.done` / `resolvePr` / `completionReview` / `qa` touchpoints emit) and routes it to the comments-sync hook — without it, a `comment <spec-id>` on an unlinked spec never reached the create-if-unlinked path. Codex mirror regenerated.
- **`sync-codex.sh` skill-preamble fallback injection is now idempotent.** The mirror generator injects the `.flow/bin/flowctl` fallback after each `FLOWCTL=` line; once the canonical preambles started carrying that line too (above), the skills-block injector emitted a **duplicate** (the agents-block injector already had the lookahead guard). The skills block now mirrors the agents-block guard — inject only when the next line isn't already the fallback.

## [flow-next 1.8.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **`/flow-next:qa` — live-app real-user QA pass derived from the spec** (fn-53). Every flow-next review today is static — `impl-review`, `spec-completion-review`, `quality-auditor`, `code-review` all read the *code*. `/flow-next:qa` fills the gap: it drives the *running* app like an unforgiving real user (via the [`flow-next-drive`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-drive/SKILL.md) surface-aware driver ladder), files structured P0/P1/P2 findings with evidence, and ends with a YES/NO ship verdict emitted as a proof-of-work receipt. New skill: [`skills/flow-next-qa/SKILL.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-qa/SKILL.md).
  - **Spec-as-intent advantage.** The differentiator vs spec-less QA tools is that flow-next already encodes intent — scenarios are derived **directly from the spec**: acceptance criteria → test scenarios, R-IDs → coverage table (reusing the make-pr R-ID pattern), boundaries → what NOT to test, decision context → expected behavior. No reconstructing app intent from README/landing/phase-docs — the spec is the source of truth.
  - **The hard rule:** QA is **forbidden from marking PASS (SHIP) by reading source** — the verdict rests on captured evidence from the live app (screenshots, console dumps, observed state), never on agent narration. This is what makes it a real-user QA pass rather than a second static review.
  - **Four-outcome verdict** carried in a `type: qa_verdict` receipt: `SHIP` (YES) / `NEEDS_WORK` (NO — a single open P0 or incomplete R-ID coverage) / **N/A** (no driveable UI, e.g. a backend/CLI-only spec) / **BLOCKED** (no live deploy or no driver — could not verify, never a fabricated PASS). The `verdict` field is the Ralph-guard enum projection (`BLOCKED → NEEDS_WORK`, `N/A → SHIP`); the four outcomes live in `qa_outcome`. Findings feed the bug memory track (`track: bug`, dedup via `memory add`'s overlap check) and are promotable to fix specs/tasks.
  - **Opt-in + graceful** (R13). Requires a live deploy + a driver; with neither it surfaces a BLOCKED limitation rather than failing, and adds nothing to the base flow when unused. Runs interactively AND autonomously (autonomous when target URL + test accounts are configured; not a hard Ralph receipt-gate in v1). Lifecycle position: after `/flow-next:work` / spec-completion-review, around / before `make-pr`.
  - **Opt-in tracker verdict post.** New `tracker.perEvent.qa` config leaf (`off | comment`, default `off`) posts the ship verdict as a tracker comment when the bridge is active — `comment` is the only sensible verb for a verdict. Documented in [`flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md#config). Unlike the other lifecycle events, it is **not** switched on by the tracker-sync discovery ceremony's opt-out default-on set — it is QA-specific opt-in.
  - **Cross-platform** (R10) — canonical Claude-native tool names (`AskUserQuestion` + `Task`/`Explore` subagent dispatch); `sync-codex.sh` rewrites for the Codex mirror, which is regenerated.
  - **QA discipline lean-borrowed (credited)** — the P0/P1/P2 taxonomy + tie-break, evidence rules (console / screenshot / URL), session-hygiene rules + persona suffixing, and the YES/NO verdict + paste-ready handoff are adapted from Ray Fernando's [`rayfernando-skills`](https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills) `running-bug-review-board` skill (Apache-2.0). flow-next stays lean (no 18-reference port; the ≤500-line skill cap holds — flow-next already has the bug memory track, receipts, the make-pr R-ID table, and the fn-52 tracker bridge). Thank you, Ray.

## [flow-next 1.7.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- **Codex implementation-delegation now short-circuits *cheaply* on non-Claude hosts — the ~45k delegation reference is never loaded into a Codex / Droid / OpenCode orchestrator's context.** The delegation platform gate (orchestrator must be Claude Code) already disabled delegation on other hosts, but it ran as Gate 1 inside `references/codex-delegation.md` — *after* the host had already read that reference. So a user with `work.delegate=codex` set who then ran `/flow-next:work` **inside Codex** pulled the whole reference into context just to have Gate 1 turn delegation off. The cheap Phase 0 value-check now ANDs in a `host_is_claude_code` check (`CLAUDECODE` set AND no `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` AND no `OPENCODE`), so `delegation_active` resolves `false` on a non-Claude host **before** the reference is ever read. **No change for Claude Code users** — the path is byte-identical when `CLAUDECODE` is set. Gate 1 stays the authoritative full platform check (it adds the `OPENCODE_*` env scan and catches the residual inherited-`CLAUDECODE` edge); the Phase 0 check is its cheap pre-load subset. Canonical-only edit (`phases.md` + `SKILL.md` + reference header); Codex mirror regenerated. New drift-proof tests extract + execute the shipped `host_is_claude_code` bash under controlled env (`test_codex_delegation_gates.py`).

## [flow-next 1.7.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Opt-in Codex implementation-delegation for `/flow-next:work`** (fn-55). `/flow-next:work` can now offload a task's *implementation* to a local `codex exec` (gpt-5.5, `medium` effort floor) while the host work skill retains **all judgment** — gating, batching, result classification, git ownership, review, and commit. **OFF by default**: with delegation off the work flow is byte-identical to today. Activate per-run with the `delegate:codex` arg token, or persistently via `work.delegate=codex` config. New host-side reference: [`skills/flow-next-work/references/codex-delegation.md`](plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-work/references/codex-delegation.md).
  - **Progressive disclosure (R3):** the default path stays a single `flowctl config get work.delegate` value-check; the full delegation mechanics (pre-flight gates, consent, invocation, classification, safety, circuit breaker) load only when `delegation_active=true`.
  - **Host pre-flight gates, run once pre-loop:** platform gate (orchestrator must be Claude Code — the mirror ships delegation disabled on non-Claude orchestrators by design), recursion guard (not already inside a Codex sandbox), availability (`codex` on PATH), one-time consent + sandbox mode, and an input-kind gate (a plan/spec/task, never a bare prompt). The generic fuzzy "use codex" is **not** a delegation trigger — it stays mapped to the review backend; only the explicit `delegate:codex` / `delegate:local` tokens (and `work.delegate`) resolve delegation.
  - **Six `work.delegate*` config keys** with defaults + precedence: `work.delegate` (`false`), `work.delegateModel` (`gpt-5.5`), `work.delegateEffort` (`medium`), `work.delegateSandbox` (`yolo`), `work.delegateConsent` (`false`), `work.delegateDecision` (`auto`). Documented in [`flowctl.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md#config).
  - **Safety:** `codex exec` is **git-forbidden** (only writes code; the worker asserts `git rev-parse HEAD == BASE_COMMIT` after the run, snapshots + restores non-scratch `.flow/`, and rolls back via a scoped `rollback-plan` — never a bare `git clean`). MCP isolation via `--ignore-user-config`. Background-launch + poll (timeout-free). Structured result schema is the proof-of-work contract; a `REVIEW_MODE=none` run still does independent verification on the delegated diff, so a delegated commit is never trusted on the Codex `verification_summary` alone. Mixed-model commits carry `AI-Orchestrator` / `AI-Implementer` trailers.
  - **Ralph-safe with pre-consent:** in autonomous mode delegation proceeds **only when `work.delegateConsent` is already `true`** (no live prompt path); every failure path falls back to standard in-session mode without stalling the loop, and a host-owned circuit breaker disables delegation for the rest of a run after repeated failures. `RALPH_GUARD_VERSION` bumped `0.14.0` → `0.15.0` — the PreToolUse guard now allows the strict canonical `codex exec` delegation shape (the prior version blocked every delegation batch in Ralph mode) while still rejecting bare/smuggled invocations.
  - **`scripts/bump.sh` now also bumps the Codex marketplace** (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), which had gone stale at `1.5.0` while the plugin advanced to `1.6.0`. All four version surfaces (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, both `plugin.json`) now bump together. Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 1.6.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Tracker-sync is now opt-OUT, not opt-in — hooking up the bridge activates the whole pipeline by default.** Previously every `tracker.perEvent.*` lifecycle touchpoint defaulted `off`, so after the discovery ceremony you had to opt each event in individually (fn-52 R1). That inverted the intent — connecting a tracker means you want it kept in sync. Now the `/flow-next:tracker-sync` discovery ceremony, on confirmation, **activates every lifecycle event by default**: capture / interview / plan → `reconcile`, work.firstClaim → `push`, work.done / makePr / resolvePr → `comment`, completionReview → `reconcile`. You exclude events at ceremony time, or turn any off afterward with `flowctl config set tracker.perEvent.<event> off`.
  - **The accidental-enable guard is preserved.** The `get_default_config()` _schema_ default for each `perEvent` leaf stays `off`, so a bare `tracker.enabled=true` set by hand or a script — **without** running the ceremony — fires **no lifecycle-event sync** (the one exception is make-pr's PR↔issue link, which is unconditional whenever the bridge is active by design — it powers Linear Diffs and does not mutate the spec); only the ceremony's explicit per-event writes (or your own `config set`) activate the lifecycle events. Activation is ceremony-gated, not flag-gated.
  - **No code/config-schema change** — the ceremony (skill) owns the default-on writes; `get_default_config()` is unchanged, so existing configs and the value-checked activation predicate are untouched. Docs updated across every surface (`tracker-sync.md`, `teams.md`, `flowctl.md`, `ralph.md`, flow-next.dev). Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 1.5.3] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Tracker-sync receipts (`.flow/sync-runs/`) are now auto-gitignored, and the managed `.flow/.gitignore` block self-upgrades on `flowctl init`.** The bridge writes a proof-of-work receipt per sync run under `.flow/sync-runs/` — the same class of runtime artifact as `receipts/` (already ignored) — but that dir was missing from flowctl's auto-managed `.flow/.gitignore`, so every sync dropped timestamped receipt files into git where they accumulated. Added `sync-runs/` to the managed pattern set. Also fixed `_ensure_flow_gitignore`: it previously **no-op'd whenever any managed block was present**, so a newly-added pattern only ever reached freshly-`init`'d repos — never existing ones; it now **reconciles** the managed block to the current canonical pattern set (user patterns below the footer preserved untouched). Existing repos pick up `sync-runs/` on their next `flowctl init`. New `test_flow_gitignore` cases cover the stale-block reconcile + the `sync-runs/` pattern. Surfaced dogfooding the bridge.

## [flow-next 1.5.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Tracker-sync now projects the ENTIRE spec to the issue body — render guardrail against summarization.** The flow→tracker push (`/flow-next:tracker-sync`) defines `renderFlowToTracker` as a full format-translation of the spec, and the body-merge Step 3.5 structural gate forbids dropping sections — but the *call sites* (`steps.md` Phase 2a + Phase 3 push skeleton) only pointed at the reference, so a host agent under token pressure could improvise a **condensed** issue body instead of mirroring the whole spec (projection is supposed to be projection-in-full). Added explicit "render the COMPLETE spec — every section, in full; never summarize/truncate" guardrails at both call sites and as the leading rule of `references/body-merge.md` Step 3 (flow→tracker), so the full-body requirement is unmissable at the point of action. No behavior change for an agent that already read the reference; closes the gap for one that didn't. Surfaced dogfooding the bridge against flow-next's own specs. Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 1.5.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:setup` shipped a `usage.md` with no tracker-sync docs.** fn-52 (1.5.0) added the `flowctl sync` / `--tracker-first` command block to the repo's dogfood `.flow/usage.md` but **not** to the bundled template `/flow-next:setup` actually copies (`plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-setup/templates/usage.md`), so every fresh setup on 1.5.0 produced a `usage.md` documenting the whole CLI **except** the tracker-sync bridge that shipped in the same release. The canonical template is now byte-synced to the dogfood copy (Codex mirror regenerated via `sync-codex.sh`).
  - **Drift guard so it can't recur:** new `test_dogfood_template_parity.py` hard-asserts `.flow/usage.md` ≡ its canonical setup template (and `.flow/templates/spec.md` ≡ `templates/spec.md`), wired into the ubuntu/macos/windows CI matrix with `.flow/usage.md` / `.flow/templates/spec.md` added to the workflow `paths` triggers. Edit the lived-in dogfood copy and forget the template → CI fails instead of consumers getting stale docs.
- **Flaky Windows CI: `migration_smoke.sh` Scenario 8b (parallel `migrate-rename`).** `_migrate_copy_tree_to_backup` listed `.flow/` via `iterdir()` then `shutil.copy2`'d each entry — but a **concurrent** migrate-rename's writability probe (`_migrate_writable`) drops a transient `.rw-probe-*.tmp` in `.flow/` that can appear in the listing then vanish before the copy opens it (`FileNotFoundError`). Classic TOCTOU; Windows widened the window (slower unlink + file locking) so it flaked there. The backup copy now skips `.rw-probe-*` by prefix and tolerates any entry that disappears mid-copy (the lock dir serialises real pre-1.0 state, so a vanishing file is always a transient).

## [flow-next 1.5.0] - 2026-06-03

> Tracker-sync bridge (fn-52). Codex mirror + plugin version bump land in fn-52.9; the flow-next.dev docs pass lands in fn-52.11.

### Added
- **`/flow-next:tracker-sync` — project a flow-next spec to an external tracker (Linear first, GitHub next) and reconcile body / status / comments two-way** (fn-52). **Projection, not coordination:** the `.flow/specs/<id>.md` spec stays the single source of truth and the quality layer; the tracker is a co-editable mirror that **never drives flow state or spawns agents** (contrast OpenAI Symphony, where the board is the control plane). Distinct from `/flow-next:sync` (plan-sync). New subsystem reference: [`docs/tracker-sync.md`](plugins/flow-next/docs/tracker-sync.md).
  - **Discovery ceremony** (detect → surface → ask → never-assume): probes Linear MCP / `LINEAR_API_KEY` / GitHub auth / a Jira host, writes `tracker.*` config only on confirmation (env > config > ask, mirroring `flowctl review-backend`). The bridge is **off until explicitly enabled** and active iff `tracker.enabled == true` OR `tracker.type ∈ {linear, github}`.
  - **Transport ladder** per adapter — Linear: MCP → GraphQL → no-op; GitHub: `gh` (single rung, reduced-fidelity status) → no-op. Transport-blind orchestration (the skill calls a normalized `fetchIssue` / `writeIssue` / `listComments` / `postComment` / `readStatus` / `setStatus` interface); when no transport is reachable the run is a `noop` + receipt note, never a crash.
  - **Hybrid id model (R16):** tracker-first specs are canonically `wor-17-slug` (tasks `wor-17-slug.M`; bare `wor-17` / `wor-17.M` resolve as aliases); flow-first specs keep `fn-NN` plus a resolvable `tracker.identifier` display alias (`WOR-17`). `show` / `work` / `plan wor-17` resolve case-insensitively; the native `fn-` scheme is reserved (`fn-N` allocation counts `fn-*` only); **one tracker team per repo**; **ids never rename** on link. `flowctl spec create --tracker-first --tracker-identifier WOR-17` keys the spec by the tracker key.
  - **`flowctl sync` plumbing:** `active` / `get-state` / `set-tracker-id` / `set-last-synced` / `set-merge-base` (paired-snapshot writer — both halves required) / `clear` / `list-unsynced` / `list-stale` / `check-collisions` / `receipt` / `defer`. Per-spec sync state (`tracker` block: id / identifier / url / `lastSyncedAt` / merge-base snapshots + hashes) lives in the `.flow/specs/<id>.json` sidecar.
  - **Ralph-safe:** every run emits a receipt; genuine conflicts **queue** to the review deferred-findings sink (`.flow/review-deferred/<branch>.md`) rather than block — no `flowctl block` needed. An `always-ask` tiebreak resolves to *queue* in autonomous mode.
  - Sync-engine shape (discovery ceremony, per-item `lastSyncedAt`, surface-diffs-never-overwrite) adapted from Ray Fernando's [`rayfernando-skills`](https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills) `running-bug-review-board` `issue-trackers.md` (Apache-2.0). Thank you, Ray.

### Changed
- **Seven lifecycle skills gain opt-in tracker-sync touchpoints** (fn-52.6) — capture, interview, plan, work (first-claim + done), make-pr, resolve-pr, spec-completion-review. Each `tracker.perEvent.*` leaf defaults `off` (values: `off | pull | push | reconcile | comment`); even `tracker.enabled=true` does nothing until a specific event opts in. The skills value-check `flowctl sync active` so the default (off) path has no transport cost.

## [flow-next 1.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **`browser` skill renamed `flow-next-drive` + rebuilt as a surface-aware driver ladder** (fn-51). The skill is no longer hardwired to a single browser driver — it now **detects the UI surface and picks the best available driver, degrading gracefully** when a richer one is absent. Three surfaces: (a) **web app** → web ladder; (b) **Chromium-backed desktop app** (Electron / Windows WebView2) → the *same* web ladder, attaching over CDP to the app's remote-debugging port (`agent-browser --cdp <port>` / `--auto-connect`; chrome-devtools-mcp `--browser-url`); (c) **true-native / non-CDP surface** (macOS AppKit/SwiftUI, or a webview exposing no CDP — e.g. macOS WKWebView / Tauri-on-macOS) → Computer Use. All surfaces share one **universal flow** (`observe / navigate → snapshot → act on fresh refs → capture evidence → release`); only the actuation + the per-rung reference differ.
  - **Web ladder** (priority order): **agent-browser** (default rung, the only assumed-present driver, CDP-based + headless-safe, no extra install) → **chrome-devtools-mcp** (auto-wait + attach-to-real-signed-in-Chrome) → **Playwright** → **cursor-ide-browser** MCP → **manual** screenshot relay. The same ladder drives Electron / WebView2 over CDP.
  - **Native rung**: Computer Use, driver-agnostic across what the host offers — **Codex Computer Use** (macOS/Windows) and/or **Anthropic "Claude" Computer Use** (the API `computer` tool, run via its own harness). Detected and optional; **never a hard dependency** and never on a headless/no-display path. When no Computer Use is present, a Chromium-backed app still drives via the web-ladder CDP attach (or its dev-server URL); a genuinely native app documents the limitation rather than fails.
  - The existing agent-browser references (`commands`, `advanced`, `auth`, `snapshot-refs`, `session-management`, `proxy`, `debugging`) fold into the agent-browser default-rung reference — **no capability regression** for current users.
  - **Driver ladder + universal-flow structure adapted from Ray Fernando's [`rayfernando-skills`](https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills) `running-bug-review-board` skill (Apache-2.0).** Thank you, Ray.

### Migration
- **`/flow-next:browser` is gone — the skill is now `/flow-next:flow-next-drive` (canonical) / `flow-next-drive` on the Codex mirror.** This also fixes the prior Codex-mirror rename to `agent-browser` (see the 1.x "Renamed Codex browser skill" entry below), which collided with the user's global `agent-browser` skill and with Codex-native browser skills — the mirror is now `flow-next-drive` on every platform, no rename.
- If an older cached install still surfaces an orphaned `browser` / `agent-browser` skill, it auto-clears within ~7 days as the plugin cache refreshes, or immediately by deleting the stale cached marketplace directory under the Claude plugin cache path (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>`).

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:make-pr` generated broken file links in PR bodies.** The rendered body used **bare relative paths** (`[\`x\`](plugins/.../x.md)`, `[fn-N.M](.flow/tasks/...)`), but GitHub resolves a relative link in a PR *description* against the page URL (`…/pull/<N>/…`) — producing 404s like `…/pull/153/plugins/...`. (`workflow.md` §2.4b wrongly claimed relative paths resolve to the default branch — true for files *in* the repo, false for PR/issue bodies.) make-pr now emits **absolute URLs chosen by purpose**: code references (Critical changes / Where to look) → per-commit **diff** + file anchor (`…/commit/<sha>#diff-<sha256(path)>`, lands on the file's change); `.flow/*` artifacts (spec / task / memory) → **blob**, SHA-pinned (survive branch deletion after merge); Evidence column → whole-commit diff. Documents the GitHub limitations that the `#diff-<hash>` anchor only auto-scrolls on a fresh load / new tab (plain same-tab clicks don't jump on large diffs) and that `target="_blank"` is stripped from PR-body markdown (new-tab can't be forced). Surfaced dogfooding PR #153.

## [flow-next 1.3.4] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Review-output R-ID parser dropped single-letter suffixes (`R4a` / `R4b`)** — `parse_unaddressed_rids` extracted R-IDs from a reviewer's `Unaddressed R-IDs:` summary line (`_extract_rids`) and from the `## Requirements coverage` table fallback with bare `\bR(\d+)\b`. fn-49.1 (1.2.1) taught the *spec* acceptance-criteria parser the `R\d+[a-z]?` suffix form but left this *review-output* path behind, so a reviewer reporting `Unaddressed R-IDs: [R4a, R4b]` parsed to drop the suffixed IDs (`[R4a, R4b, R5]` → `['R5']`) — the R-ID coverage gate and fix-loop targeting silently lost exactly the new form. Both review-output regexes are now `\bR(\d+[a-z]?)\b`, in lockstep with the spec parser; multi-letter suffixes (`R4ab`) and separators (`R-4`) stay rejected. New `test_unaddressed_rids_parser.py` (10 cases: summary-line + coverage-table suffix survival, plain-R-ID back-compat, dedup order, malformed rejection) wired into the ubuntu/macos/windows CI matrix. Surfaced by a live impl-review A/B run in 1.3.x — the current review prompt (no experimental slop rubric) caught it.

## [flow-next 1.3.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Scout `.clawpatch/` enrichment now resolves `flowctl` as a dispatched subagent** — fn-50.3 added `repo-scout`/`context-scout` Step 0 calls to `flowctl repo-map list --json`, but when these agents run as dispatched subagents they may not inherit `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT`, so `FLOWCTL="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl"` resolved to a broken `/scripts/flowctl` → `repo-map` failed → the scout silently grep-degraded and `features_anchored` never fired even with a populated `.clawpatch/`. Both scouts' Step 0 now add `[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"`, so a `/flow-next:setup`-installed repo resolves the bundled copy regardless of subprocess env. Surfaced by live end-to-end testing (mapping flow-next's own repo via `--source=agent` → 9 features, then exercising the scout enrichment).
- **`scripts/sync-codex.sh` agent-body FLOWCTL injection is now idempotent** — the fn-50.6 rewrite injected the `.flow/bin/flowctl` fallback unconditionally after the Codex `FLOWCTL=` line; with the canonical now carrying that fallback too, the mirror got a duplicate line. The awk now skips injection when the next line is already the fallback (END-injects only when `FLOWCTL=` is the last line). repo-scout / context-scout / worker mirror tomls carry exactly one fallback each; sync is byte-idempotent.
- **`test_scout_fallback_contract.py` plumbing check is hermetic** — it now runs `flowctl repo-map list` in a throwaway git repo instead of the in-repo `tests/fixtures/scout-without-clawpatch/` fixture. `repo-map` resolves `.clawpatch/` from git toplevel, so the fixture subdir couldn't isolate from a real `.clawpatch/` created by local dogfooding at repo root (the test failed locally though it passed in CI, where `.clawpatch/` is gitignored and absent).

## [flow-next 1.3.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`/flow-next:map` surfaces a heuristic-0-features hint** — live-testing on flow-next's own repo (clawpatch 0.4.0) showed the provider-free heuristic mapper returns **0 features** for repos that don't match clawpatch's conventional app/framework detectors (npm bins, Next.js routes, Python packages, Rails/Laravel/Django, Go/Rust, JVM, .NET, SwiftPM, Phoenix). flow-next's own repo — plugin + markdown-skill + `flowctl.py` CLI + bun TUI — matches none, so heuristic produced 0 features while clawpatch flagged `weak=true`. The Phase 5 summary previously printed a silent "Mapped: 0 feature(s)"; it now explains the conventional-layout targeting and suggests `--source=auto` (heuristic-first, provider only if weak) or `--source=agent` (always provider-backed), noting both need `CLAWPATCH_PROVIDER` + tokens. (`--source=agent` via codex produced 9 well-scoped features for flow-next in testing.) `SKILL.md` + docs note the same. Behavioral addition on the 0-feature path only; happy path unchanged.

### Fixed
- **`.gitignore` ignores `.clawpatch/` at repo root** — the `/flow-next:map` skill writes a self-contained `.clawpatch/.gitignore` (`*` + `!.gitignore`) for user repos, but the `!.gitignore` negation leaves that one file trackable, and flow-next's own `work` skill stages via `git add -A`. Root-ignoring `.clawpatch/` keeps the dogfood repo's local feature map (regenerable via `/flow-next:map --source=agent`) out of the plugin repo.

## [flow-next 1.3.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:map` PNPM_HOME hint reworded** — live-testing 1.3.0 on a machine where `clawpatch` was never installed (pnpm 10.26.2) surfaced two copy bugs in the R11 install-failure hint. (1) The hint asserted "pnpm is installed but `clawpatch` is not on PATH … install succeeds but PATH is unchanged" — but it fires on `command -v pnpm` + `pnpm bin -g` success alone, before knowing whether the user ever ran `pnpm add -g clawpatch`; a first-time user who simply hasn't installed reads "install succeeds but PATH unchanged" and thinks something broke. (2) The "pnpm v11 moved global binaries to `$PNPM_HOME/bin/` … if you upgraded from pnpm 10" framing was wrong for pnpm-10 users (tester's global bin resolved to `~/.local/share/pnpm`). Reworded to conditional framing — "If you already ran `pnpm add -g clawpatch` and still see this, that directory is likely not on your PATH; pnpm installs global binaries under `$PNPM_HOME` and needs a one-time `pnpm setup`" — correct for both never-installed and installed-but-not-on-PATH, no version-specific claim. Same correction applied to `docs/troubleshooting.md`. Logic unchanged; `test_pnpm_home_hint_prose.py` (5) + `map_smoke_test.sh` Case 4b (75) stay green. Codex mirror regenerated.

## [flow-next 1.3.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`/flow-next:map` skill** wrapping [openclaw/clawpatch](https://github.com/openclaw/clawpatch)'s `clawpatch map` CLI to produce a semantic feature index of the repo (~20 languages, persisted at `.clawpatch/features/*.json`, Zod-validated `schemaVersion: 1`) (fn-50). Opt-in convenience — `flowctl` core never imports or requires clawpatch; skill detects install via `command -v clawpatch`, prints `pnpm add -g clawpatch` install instructions verbatim when missing (no auto-install), runs `clawpatch init` when `.clawpatch/` absent + writes a self-contained `.clawpatch/.gitignore` skeleton (repo `.gitignore` untouched). Default invocation is `--source heuristic` (provider-free, zero LLM calls, deterministic mapper); `--source auto|agent` is exposed as passthrough (clawpatch's provider matrix stays orthogonal to flow-next's review backend). Single-source `SUPPORTED_CLAWPATCH=">=0.4.0 <0.5.0"` version pin lives in skill prose; outside-range → one-line stderr warning + degrade, never block. PNPM_HOME PATH detection prints the `pnpm setup` hint when pnpm's global bin dir isn't on PATH. Ralph-block (decline-to-run, no receipt write) under `FLOW_RALPH=1` / `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH`.
- **`flowctl repo-map list / show / since-ref` reader subcommands** parse `.clawpatch/features/*.json` directly — text + `--json` output (fn-50.2). Readers BYPASS `ensure_flow_exists()` and gate on `.clawpatch/` presence instead — return `count: 0` with exit 0 when absent so prime's DE7 detection works without special-casing. `schemaVersion != 1` triggers a one-line stderr diagnostic + skip without aborting the full list. Unparseable JSON gets the same skip-with-diagnostic path. `since-ref` returns `success: false` cleanly on non-git repos or unknown refs (exit 0).
- **Scout enrichment (`repo-scout` + `context-scout`)** — both agents call `flowctl repo-map list --json` as Step 0 when `.clawpatch/` is present and emit an optional `features_anchored: [...]` field in their structured output, including a `last_mapped` timestamp for staleness awareness (staleness = informational signal, not a block) (fn-50.3). Field is purely additive scout-level enrichment — downstream skills (`/flow-next:plan`, `/flow-next:capture`) consume scout output as-is. Fallback contract is load-bearing: scouts remain useful with the existing grep/glob flow when `.clawpatch/` is absent.
- **`/flow-next:prime` `DE7` sub-criterion** added under Pillar 5 (Dev Environment) — "Codebase feature map present? — `/flow-next:map` recommended for richer scope anchoring (optional)" (fn-50.5). Detection: `[[ -d .clawpatch ]]` + `flowctl repo-map list --count > 0`. Reporting: soft ❌ (informational, mirrors the DC7 pattern); surfaces `/flow-next:map` as actionable suggestion in `Top Recommendations`. **No auto-run.** Pillar count stays at 8; **scored criteria stay at 48** (DC7 + DE7 both informational, excluded from baseline); **total criteria become 48 → 49** with DE7 added.
- **`GLOSSARY.md`** entries for "feature map" and "features_anchored" (fn-50.6).
- **CLAUDE.md + setup-template snippets** (`claude-md-snippet.md` + `agents-md-snippet.md`) gain a one-paragraph optional-add under "Where to look" describing `/flow-next:map` as a discoverability aid (fn-50.4). Setup-template changes propagate to existing user repos via the fn-45.3 byte-compare gate.

### Changed
- **`STRATEGY.md`** zero-deps track gains an opt-in-skill clarification sentence noting `/flow-next:map` is opt-in convenience; `flowctl` core stays zero-dep (fn-50.6).
- **Codex mirror registration** — `flow-next-map` added to `scripts/sync-codex.sh` `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` array + `generate_openai_yaml` call (utility amber `#F59E0B`); Codex mirror regenerated under `plugins/flow-next/codex/skills/flow-next-map/` (fn-50.6).
- **Cross-platform parity** — `plugins/flow-next/docs/platforms.md` gains an "Optional skill requirements" section naming `/flow-next:map` Node 22+ requirement; `plugins/flow-next/docs/troubleshooting.md` gains a clawpatch-failure-modes section (missing binary, PNPM_HOME PATH, version mismatch, Node 20) (fn-50.6).
- **Plugin description string** — skill count bumped 23 → 24 in `plugins/flow-next/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/flow-next/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (fn-50.6). Scored-criterion count stays "48" (DE7 informational per fn-50.5).

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:map` config-state echo now reports the actual review backend** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). The fn-50.1 Phase 0.2 echo called `flowctl config get review.backend` without `--json` and then grepped for a JSON `"value"` field — text mode returns `review.backend: <value>` (NOT JSON), so the grep returned empty and the line always defaulted to `none` regardless of the user's actual config. Now passes `--json` so the four-line R12 header reflects reality. `map_smoke_test.sh` Case 6a (new) statically asserts `config get review.backend --json` appears verbatim in `workflow.md` so the regression can't sneak back.
- **`map_smoke_test.sh` Case 4 now uses a hermetic test PATH** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). The `PATH="$BASH_DIR"` strategy was too narrow on systems where bash lives outside the coreutils directory (e.g. Homebrew bash at `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` on macOS) — the replayed `install_guard.sh` couldn't find `cat`/`command`/`dirname` and 8 assertions failed with rc=127. New `HERMETIC_PATH="$BASH_DIR:/usr/bin:/bin"` includes bash + standard coreutils while still excluding Node-global directories where the user's real `clawpatch`/`pnpm` would live. Case 4b prepends the pnpm stub directory in front of the same hermetic PATH so the stub resolves first.
- **`/flow-next:prime` DE7 detection now uses the bundled `$FLOWCTL` prelude** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). Bare `flowctl repo-map list --count` would fail silently on plugin installs because `flowctl` is bundled, not on `PATH` — repos with a valid `.clawpatch/` index would still report DE7 missing (stderr hidden). `workflow.md` DE7 detection block now sets the canonical Droid+Claude fallback prelude (`FLOWCTL="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl"` + `[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"`) and calls `"$FLOWCTL" repo-map list --count`. `pillars.md` DE7 row updated to match. sync-codex.sh rewrites the prelude to `$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl` for the Codex mirror automatically.
- **`set -e` no longer eats the `clawpatch map` exit code** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). fn-50.1's Phase 4 invocation captured `MAP_EXIT=$?` after `clawpatch map`, but the script's `set -euo pipefail` preamble caused the shell to exit on a non-zero `clawpatch` exit BEFORE the capture line ran — so the diagnostic + propagated exit code were unreachable. Wrapped the call in `set +e` / `set -e` so the failure path actually executes.
- **`.clawpatch/.gitignore` skeleton now honors the spec's directory-level ignore contract** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). The fn-50.1 skeleton only ignored `.cache/`, `*.log`, `*.tmp`, and `patches/*.tmp` — leaving the generated `features/*.json`, `project.json`, and `config.json` visible to `git add -A`, which contradicted the spec's "`.clawpatch/` ignored at directory level" edge case and the cleaner-uninstall story. Skeleton rewritten to `*` + `!.gitignore` (catch-all with self-negation), so all generated state is ignored while the ignore-rule file itself stays tracked. The persisted index is reproducible from `clawpatch map` — checking it in would create review noise and couple PRs to mapper-output drift. `map_smoke_test.sh` Case 5d (new) seeds a throwaway git repo with plausible clawpatch outputs and asserts `git check-ignore` returns 0 for `features/auth.json`, `project.json`, `config.json`, `.cache/x`, `foo.log`, `foo.tmp`, `patches/p.tmp` and exit 1 for `.gitignore` itself — locks the contract in CI.
- **`scripts/sync-codex.sh` agent generator now rewrites the FLOWCTL prelude** (fn-50.6, Codex review catch). Canonical agents in `plugins/flow-next/agents/*.md` use `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl`, but inside Codex neither env var is set — the expansion resolved to `/scripts/flowctl`, broken. The skill mirror has the right rewrite (line ~183); the agent `.md → .toml` converter at line ~1260 was missing the equivalent transform, so fn-50.3's repo-scout + context-scout `repo-map` probes would have silently failed in Codex when `.clawpatch/` existed. Sync now rewrites `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl` → `$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl` in agent bodies and injects the `[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"` local fallback after every match (POSIX awk; no gawk-only constructs). Side-effect: `worker.toml` memory-capture block also gets the fix. Idempotent.

### Tests
- **CI matrix coverage** — `.github/workflows/test-flow-next.yml` gains explicit `python -m unittest discover -p "test_repo_map.py"` (fn-50.2, 21 tests) and `python -m unittest discover -p "test_scout_fallback_contract.py"` (fn-50.3, 14 tests) steps so both run on ubuntu / macos / windows. New `map_smoke_test.sh` (fn-50.1 + fn-50.6, 74 cases — install-detect, version-range, Ralph-block, .gitignore skeleton + directory-level ignore guard via `git check-ignore`, config-state echo, argument parsing) wired with the existing `cd "$RUNNER_TEMP" && bash "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/..."` pattern. Tests use checked-in fixtures at `plugins/flow-next/tests/fixtures/clawpatch-map/` — runners do not need Node 22+ or clawpatch installed.

## [flow-next 1.2.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **R-ID parser silently dropped acceptance criteria with single-letter suffixes** (fn-49.1). `_export_parse_acceptance_criteria` regex was `R\d+` — capture-driven specs with sub-scoped sibling criteria like `R4a` / `R4b` (surfaced during fn-48's make-pr against `.flow/specs/fn-48-backend-split-review-workflows-flowctl.md`) were silently excluded from `spec.spec_sections.acceptance_criteria[]` and `tasks_summary.uncovered_r_ids`. Pre-fix: fn-48 export reported `acceptance_count: 7`; post-fix: `9`. Regex extended to `R\d+[a-z]?` (single lowercase suffix only — `R4ab` and `R-4` still reject). Lexical sort preserves `R4 < R4a < R4b < R5` ordering. `plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md` documents the suffix form for sub-scoped siblings.
- **`memory_during_spec` time-window filter degraded to "all entries ever" when `spec.created_at` was null** (fn-49.2). `_export_memory_during_epic` previously treated a missing spec timestamp as "no threshold" and returned every memory entry under scoped categories — too broad for specs created via `/flow-next:capture` in the same session as `flowctl init` (or pre-timestamp-population specs), which then pollutes `/flow-next:make-pr` output with pre-spec context. New `_export_resolve_memory_threshold` walks a deterministic chain — spec → earliest `tasks[].created_at` → branch first-commit via `git log {base_ref}..{branch_name} --reverse --format=%cI` → no-signal fall-through to "return all". Chain stops at first success so consecutive runs against the same repo return identical thresholds. Surfaced during fn-48 make-pr where `factory-droid-platform-status-2026-05-2026-05-25` was the reproducer — fn-48's `created_at` was backfilled by the time the spec landed, but the underlying null-safety hole remained.
- **Branch-first-commit fallback returned the branch tip date, not the root commit's date** (Codex bot P1 review on PR #147). `git log <branch> --reverse --format=%cI --max-count=1` is wrong: `--max-count` is a selection option applied BEFORE output ordering, so combined with `--reverse` it picks the most recent commit and then "reverses" a 1-element list (no-op). In the null-`spec.created_at` path the fallback used the most-recent commit as the time-window lower bound, filtering out older in-window memory entries — the same class of bug fn-49.2 was supposed to prevent. Fix: drop `--max-count=1`; the existing `splitlines()[0]` on the reversed stream is the deterministic way to grab the first commit. Pre-fix unit tests passed because the synthetic fixture had a single commit where root == tip — new `test_branch_first_commit_returns_root_not_tip` uses a multi-commit fixture (root 2026-05-25 / tip 2026-05-30) and would have caught this.
- **Branch-first-commit fallback walked inherited mainline history, returning the repo root commit's date** (Codex bot P2 review on PR #147). `git log <branch>` walks ALL commits reachable from the branch tip — including everything inherited from `main`. With `--reverse` + `splitlines()[0]` the fallback returned the repository root commit's date (way too old), effectively reverting `memory_during_epic` to near-unfiltered output whenever `spec.created_at` and task timestamps were both missing. Fix: thread `base_ref` through `_export_resolve_memory_threshold` and `_export_memory_during_epic`; the branch fallback now uses `git log {base_ref}..{branch_name}` so only commits unique to the feature branch are walked. Falls back to `git log <branch>` as best-effort when no base context is supplied (unit tests on detached fixtures). New `test_branch_first_commit_excludes_base_history` builds a synthetic repo with a multi-commit `trunk` (root 2026-01-01) + feature branch with a 2026-05-25 commit; asserts threshold = `2026-05-25` (fork point) with `base_ref`, and `2026-01-01` (repo root) without — locks both call-site behaviors.

### Tests
- `tests/test_acceptance_criteria_parser.py` extended with 8 R-ID-form cases: all-suffixed, mixed plain+suffixed, R4+R4a+R4b coexistence, lexical sort, and rejection of multi-letter suffix / separator / lowercase forms.
- New `tests/test_memory_during_spec_null_safe.py` — 14 cases covering the fallback chain: spec wins when present, earliest-task fallback when spec null + tasks have timestamps, branch first-commit fallback via a synthetic git repo (pinned `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` for determinism), multi-commit-branch returns root-not-tip (P1 regression lock), branch first-commit excludes base history when `base_ref` supplied (P2 regression lock), no-signal return-all preserves the graceful-degradation contract, empty-string task entries filtered safely, invalid branch falls through cleanly, missing memory dir returns empty structure.
- Suite total: 646 unit tests pass on this release (was 624 before fn-48 + fn-49 cycle; 22 new across the two test files).

### Co-credit
- `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` flagged both the P1 (max-count + reverse) and P2 (branch-vs-base history) bugs on PR #147 inline review threads. Both were valid findings with clean root-cause descriptions; the regressions are now locked by dedicated tests.

## [flow-next 1.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **Review-skill workflows are now backend-split** (fn-48). `spec-completion-review/workflow.md` (645 LOC) and `impl-review/workflow.md` (1126 LOC) were split into `workflow-common.md` (Phase 0 detection + cross-backend gated phases) + per-backend files (`workflow-rp.md`, `workflow-codex.md`, `workflow-copilot.md`). SKILL.md routes to the active backend's file by `$BACKEND`; only that one loads per invocation. **Per-invocation context savings on Codex/Copilot: spec-completion-review 645 → 41 LOC (14×), impl-review 1126 → 70 LOC (16×).** RP loads workflow-common (~565 LOC) + workflow-rp (~465-489 LOC); the cohesive RP prompt template intentionally stays in one place since it's only loaded under the RP backend anyway. `resolve-pr` was evaluated and kept inline — divergence (~22 lines of parallel-vs-serial dispatch) sits below the 50-line split threshold codified in `agent_docs/adding-skills.md`. Mechanical refactor only — bash, gating, and verdict semantics unchanged across all backends.
- **Codex mirror FLOWCTL prelude dropped the dead `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` / `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` fallback chain** (fn-48.1). Inside Codex neither var is ever set; the existing `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.codex}}` chain was dead code. The single `sed` rewrite rule in `scripts/sync-codex.sh` now emits the direct `FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"` form. Zero behavior change — the resolved value is identical in every Codex environment.
- **Canonical FLOWCTL prelude consolidated to once-per-skill-file** (fn-48.6, R4b "Path A modified"). The 100-byte `FLOWCTL="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl"` boilerplate previously repeated on every flowctl-invoking bash block (41 of 117 bash calls in a recent fn-45 cycle started with it). Each canonical skill file (SKILL.md, workflow.md / phases.md / steps.md as applicable) now defines the variable ONCE in a `## Preamble` section near the top; subsequent bash blocks call `$FLOWCTL` bare. `flow-next-ralph-init` uses the same pattern with `PLUGIN_ROOT="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}"` to collapse 10+ inline expansions in the cp commands. `scripts/sync-codex.sh` gained complementary rewrite rules for the new `$PLUGIN_ROOT/...` form. New `## FLOWCTL prelude consolidation (heuristic)` section in `agent_docs/adding-skills.md` documents the pattern sibling to the existing backend-split heuristic (fn-48.5).
- **Factory Droid platform contract re-verified against Factory docs on 2026-05-25** (fn-48.2). Findings recorded as a knowledge/decisions entry at `.flow/memory/knowledge/decisions/factory-droid-platform-status-2026-05-2026-05-25.md`. (1) `DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` is still Droid's canonical plugin-root env var (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is documented as the Claude Code compat alias) — the `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` env-var fallback in the FLOWCTL prelude **stays**. (2) Droid's hooks-reference still lists `Execute` (not `Bash`) as the canonical shell-command tool name — the `"matcher": "Bash|Execute"` regex-OR in `hooks/hooks.json` **stays**. (3) Droid auto-translates Claude Code plugin format via its interop layer for Claude-first plugins like flow-next — the `.factory-plugin/plugin.json` fallback at 9 canonical sites (`flow-next-{capture,strategy,make-pr,interview,plan,audit,prospect,memory-migrate}/SKILL.md` + `flow-next-setup/workflow.md`) was **dropped** as dead code. The `sync-codex.sh:206` `'s|\.factory-plugin/plugin\.json|.claude-plugin/plugin.json|g'` rewrite is kept as defense-in-depth (now effectively a no-op).

### Verification
- **Smoke baseline parity.** `bash plugins/flow-next/scripts/smoke_test.sh` from clean tempdir on the feature branch: **127 pass / 2 fail**. The 2 failures (`copilot plan-review e2e`, `copilot impl-review e2e`) reproduce identically on `main` baseline (verified by `git stash` + `git checkout main` + re-run; same stale-session-UUID errors from the Copilot CLI). Pre-existing, unrelated to this refactor.
- **sync-codex.sh idempotency.** Mirror hash stable across consecutive `./scripts/sync-codex.sh` runs (`md5sum`-of-`md5sum`s validated). All 14 sync validators green.
- **Static verification campaign** (no behavioral test gap in the refactor, so verified statically): content completeness (heading + bullet diff of pre-split `workflow.md` against union of split files — every section preserved, only structural promotions and per-backend extraction of cross-backend sections like `Anti-patterns`); routing correctness (SKILL.md `Step 1: Detect Backend + Load Workflow` table + workflow-common.md Phase 0 table — both anchor the host agent at the right per-backend file); Codex mirror integrity (4 expected rewrites all confirmed: `DROID:-CLAUDE` chain → direct `$HOME/.codex`, `AskUserQuestion` → 0 occurrences, `ToolSearch` → 0 occurrences, RP slowness warning prefix inserted at top of `workflow-rp.md` in mirror); cross-reference integrity (54 internal `.md` links across the three split skills, every target resolves in canonical AND mirror); flowctl review CLI entrypoints unchanged (`flowctl {codex,copilot} {impl-review,completion-review,validate,deep-pass}` + `flowctl rp` — same args, same flags as pre-fn-48).

## [flow-next 1.1.11] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`flowctl init` no longer silently flips pre-1.1.3 users' `planSync.crossEpic` from on to off.** Caught while auditing `/flow-next:setup` against the dev repo (this fix's sibling 1.1.10 PR surfaced the `.flow/config.json` diff). Pre-1.1.3 users have `planSync.crossEpic: true` (the only key) in their on-disk config. 1.1.3 introduced `planSync.crossSpec: false` as the new canonical default, and the 1.1.3 read precedence is "canonical wins on presence". Without a pre-merge mirror, every upgrading user who'd opted into cross-spec sync lost the setting on the next `flowctl init` (which `/flow-next:setup` runs unconditionally + bundled worker paths). `flowctl init` now detects the legacy-without-canonical state and mirrors `crossEpic` → `crossSpec` before the default-merge so the canonical key reflects the user's intended setting. Legacy key is preserved per the 1.1.3 deprecation cadence (removed in 2.0). Mirror is idempotent — only runs when legacy is set and canonical is absent.

### Tests
- `tests/test_init_crossspec_mirror.py` — 5 cases: mirrors `True` legacy, mirrors `False` legacy, canonical-present takes precedence (no mirror), neither-set fresh-install (no mirror), idempotent on re-run.

## [flow-next 1.1.10] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:setup` template `usage.md` was stale and missing 3 documented CLI surfaces + most of the per-project knobs.** Caught when re-running `/flow-next:setup` on the dev repo bumped its `setup_version` from 0.24.0 to 1.1.9 and the byte-compare gate flagged `.flow/usage.md` as customized. Root cause: the `fn-43.12 user-facing docs sweep` (commit `445a4ef`) updated only the dev repo's `.flow/usage.md` with new prospect / spec export-cognitive-aid / `.flow_version` sentinel content; the canonical template at `plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-setup/templates/usage.md` was never backported, so every fresh `/flow-next:setup` from 0.42.0 onward shipped a `.flow/usage.md` missing those sections. Promoted the richer dev-repo version to the canonical template AND extended it with the surfaces neither version covered: `flowctl status`, `config get/set` (all five knobs: review.backend, memory.enabled, planSync.enabled, planSync.crossSpec, scouts.github), per-spec / per-task `set-backend` + `show-backend` + `review-backend`, `checkpoint save/restore/delete`, `ralph pause/resume/stop/status`, `spec set-plan/set-title/set-branch/close/skeleton/add-dep/rm-dep`, `task set-description/set-acceptance/set-spec/reset`, `block --reason-file`. Also corrected the `specs/*.md` vs `specs/*.json` framing (.md is canonical content; .json is metadata — template had them reversed) and expanded the file-structure diagram to mention `templates/spec.md`, `review-receipts/`, `review-deferred/`, the `memory/{bug,knowledge}/<category>/` shape, and `STRATEGY.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` as out-of-`.flow/` canonical files. Template grew 100 → 212 lines.

### Documentation
- Same canonical content also written to this repo's `.flow/usage.md` so the dev install stays byte-identical to what the setup template ships.

## [flow-next 1.1.9] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`flowctl copilot {impl,plan,completion}-review` now works on native Windows.** 1.1.8 added a fail-fast guard that pointed Windows users at WSL because Copilot CLI's `-p <text>` argv path collides with the `CreateProcessW` 32,767-char limit for spec-sized prompts. Turns out Copilot CLI (≥1.0.51) DOES accept the prompt via stdin — undocumented in `--help` and surfaced only as a passing mention in [github/copilot-cli#3398](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3398) — so flow-next can sidestep the cap entirely. `run_copilot_exec` now branches on `sys.platform == "win32"`: Windows uses `subprocess.run(input=prompt, ...)` with no `-p`, POSIX paths stay on argv. Stdin-mode `--resume=<uuid>` is **resume-only** (errors with "No session matched" on first call, unlike `-p` mode's create-or-resume), so the Windows path uses `--session-id=<uuid>` for the first call and `--resume=<uuid>` afterwards, tracked via a touch marker under `.flow/tmp/copilot-sessions/<uuid>`. Removes the 1.1.8 `_copilot_windows_argv_too_long` guard + constants — the failure mode it caught can't happen anymore.

### Tests
- New `tests/test_copilot_run_exec.py` — 5 mocked unit tests covering POSIX argv path, Windows first-call `--session-id`, Windows second-call `--resume`, failed-first-call marker absence, Windows path emits no temp prompt files. Cross-platform via `mock.patch.object(sys, "platform", ...)`.
- New `tests/test_copilot_windows_smoke.py` — Windows-only real-subprocess smoke. Stands up a fake `copilot.bat` shim, prepends to `PATH`, runs `run_copilot_exec` with a 60 KB prompt through real `CreateProcessW` + stdin pipe, validates the child received the exact bytes (SHA-256 round-trip). Skipped on non-Windows; mocked unit tests cover behavior there.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/test-flow-next.yml` runs both new test files on the full ubuntu/macos/windows matrix. The Windows smoke fires only on `windows-latest`.

### Documentation
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/platforms.md` rewritten — the 1.1.8 "blocked on Windows, use WSL" sections now document the working Windows stdin path. Pointer to upstream `--prompt-file` request preserved.

### Removed
- `_copilot_windows_argv_too_long`, `WINDOWS_CMDLINE_CAP_CHARS`, `WINDOWS_CMDLINE_SAFETY_MARGIN` — the 1.1.8 guard is no longer reachable now that Windows uses stdin. Test file `tests/test_copilot_windows_argv_guard.py` removed.
- Error string "copilot -p failed: ..." → "copilot failed: ..." (the `-p` is path-specific; Windows path omits it).

## [flow-next 1.1.8] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`flowctl copilot {impl,plan,completion}-review` now fails fast on Windows with an actionable error instead of an opaque `OSError winerror 206`.** Reported by Simon Flauger (SEMA-CAD) — spec-sized review prompts on native Windows + Copilot review backend deterministically blow the Windows `CreateProcessW` 32,767-char command-line cap. Copilot CLI (1.0.51 as of today) offers no `--prompt-file` / `@file` / stdin prompt delivery path, so flow-next has no way to stage the prompt off argv on Windows. The temp-file staging in `run_copilot_exec` is a hygiene scratch buffer, not an alternate delivery — it still reads the file back into argv. New `_copilot_windows_argv_too_long` guard (pure helper) projects the command-line length before `subprocess.run`, and on overflow returns the same `("", session_id, 2, msg)` tuple as the timeout path so callers surface a clean `copilot -p failed: ...` with the actual sizes, the Copilot-CLI cause, and the WSL workaround pointer. macOS / Linux / WSL hosts are unaffected. Tests in `tests/test_copilot_windows_argv_guard.py`.

### Documentation
- New `docs/troubleshooting.md` section "Copilot review backend fails on Windows" + `docs/platforms.md` section "Windows + Copilot review backend (limitation)" — both explain the cap, the Copilot-CLI cause, and point at WSL as the workaround.

### Upstream
- Filed a Windows-specific data point on [github/copilot-cli#3398](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3398) ("Add a `--prompt-file <path>` flag") requesting first-class off-argv prompt delivery so this stops being a workaround. The real fix lives upstream.

## [flow-next 1.1.7] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`request_user_input` no longer leaks into Codex mirror SKILL.md `allowed-tools:` frontmatter.** fn-45 (v1.1.2) rewrote canonical `AskUserQuestion` to plain-text numbered prompts in mirror prose, but the `allowed-tools:` frontmatter rewrite preserved the tool token on the assumption that Codex reads `agents/openai.yaml` for the contract and treats SKILL.md frontmatter as "harmless residue". In practice the agent reads the frontmatter, trusts the listed tools, and calls `request_user_input` — which errors in Default mode (openai/codex #10384, #11536, #12694), exactly the failure fn-45 was meant to eliminate. Symptom reproduced by a user running `/flow-next:make-pr` from a Codex Desktop Default-mode session: "Preview gate tool unavailable in Default mode". `sync-codex.sh` Stage 3 H now STRIPS `AskUserQuestion` from the mirror's `allowed-tools:` line (cleaning adjacent commas) instead of rewriting it; the R6 mirror-scan guard now also fails sync on any `^allowed-tools:.*\brequest_user_input\b` match so future regressions surface immediately. 6 affected mirror SKILL.md files cleaned: `flow-next-make-pr`, `flow-next-capture`, `flow-next-audit`, `flow-next-strategy`, `flow-next-memory-migrate`, `flow-next-prospect`.

## [flow-next 1.1.6] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:prime` SE1 (branch protection) now detects ruleset-based enforcement, not just classic branch protection.** Reported by Georg Keller (SEMA-CAD) — on GHE Enterprise, repo `main` was correctly protected via Enterprise-level rulesets (2 required reviews, Copilot review required, force-push / deletion blocked, GitFlow naming, file-path restrictions) but `agents/security-scout.md` only probed `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection` (legacy classic-protection endpoint) and treated the 404 as "not protected" — a false negative that surfaced as `SE1 ❌` in the Pillar 7 report and incorrectly recommended adding CODEOWNERS to enforce "Senior Developer" review. Scout now also probes `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch}` (rulesets endpoint, covering repo / org / enterprise layers) and marks SE1 ✅ if EITHER endpoint returns enforcement (`pull_request`, `non_fast_forward`, `deletion`, `required_status_checks`, `required_linear_history`, `required_signatures`, `required_deployments`, or `code_scanning` rule types). Output template gains a `Mechanism: classic / rulesets / both` line + ruleset IDs when applicable. Pillar 7 (`pillars.md:151`) SE1 criterion updated to reflect both mechanisms. Classic branch protection is on GitHub's long-term deprecation path; rulesets are the canonical mechanism going forward.

## [flow-next 1.1.5] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **`/flow-next:refine --scope=business` no longer asks about deadlines, time budgets, or duration-based prioritization.** Agents can't estimate their own work, so the previous "Deadlines and what drives them" / "Cuts we'd accept to ship two weeks faster" / "engineering time" framing collapsed the interview into a cascade of brutal-prioritization follow-ups whenever the user mentioned any time pressure (e.g. answering "in 2 hours" to a deadline question would re-trigger MVP-Scope and What-NOT-to-Build re-asks from a time-pressure angle). Removed the time-bearing bullets from `questions-business.md` MVP Scope and Business Constraints; replaced with feature-value framing (concrete cuts the PO would accept if scope must shrink, infra/vendor/licensing budget envelope, external dependencies that must be honored). Added explicit guardrail to `questions-business.md` Business Constraints and to `SKILL.md` "NOT in scope" section: do not ask about deadlines / sprint cadence / "ship before X"; if the user volunteers a deadline in answer to another question, acknowledge it without cascading into prioritization re-asks. 5 manifest surfaces aligned at 1.1.5 via `scripts/bump.sh patch flow-next`.

## [flow-next 1.1.4] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Spec acceptance-criteria heading alignment.** The canonical scaffold at `plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md` (fn-44 / 1.1.0+) uses `## Acceptance Criteria`, but the `/flow-next:plan` skill's heredoc template wrote `## Acceptance` — so plan-generated specs (e.g. fn-46) shipped with a heading the `flowctl spec export-cognitive-aid` parser didn't recognize, returning empty `acceptance_criteria` for those specs. Aligned the plan template + supporting prose (5 sites in `flow-next-plan/steps.md`, 1 site in `agents/plan-sync.md`) to write `## Acceptance Criteria` canonically. New plan output matches the bundled template + canonical parser key going forward.
- **Parser tolerance for legacy heading variants.** `_export_parse_acceptance_criteria` now accepts the canonical `## Acceptance Criteria` (preferred), the legacy `## Acceptance criteria` (older lowercase form), AND the legacy `## Acceptance` (plan template pre-1.1.4 + `flowctl spec skeleton` output locked by R22). Existing specs that ship `## Acceptance` continue to parse cleanly — no migration required for merged specs. Reviewer prompt block updated to declare canonical + tolerate the two legacy forms.

### Internal
- `flowctl spec skeleton` and `flowctl prospect promote` CLI heredocs intentionally keep `## Acceptance` (R22 byte-for-byte invariant on the fresh-spec skeleton). The parser tolerance covers their output transparently.
- 5 new unit tests in `test_acceptance_criteria_parser.py` lock the canonical + 2 legacy heading forms; rejects `## Acceptance Tests` (distinct concept) as a non-match.
- 5 manifest surfaces aligned at 1.1.4 via `scripts/bump.sh patch flow-next`.

## [flow-next 1.1.3] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`planSync.crossSpec` is the canonical cross-spec plan-sync config key.** `flowctl config get / set` now writes `crossSpec` exclusively; `set` never touches the legacy key. `get` prefers `crossSpec` and falls back to `planSync.crossEpic` only when the canonical key is **absent from the raw `.flow/config.json` file** (the `load_flow_config()` deep-merge would otherwise mask a "user has only set legacy" state with the new default of `false`). Default in `get_default_config()` switches to `crossSpec: false`; the legacy key is removed from defaults so its presence in the file signals an explicit legacy set. Reuses `_emit_rename_deprecation` from fn-43 (per-process dedup via `_RENAME_DEPRECATION_EMITTED`; honors `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1`). `flow-next-setup/workflow.md` (5 sites: lines 237, 268, 309, 415, 497) and `agents/plan-sync.md:19` updated to reference the canonical key as source of truth.
- **Spec template discovery cascade.** `/flow-next:capture`, `/flow-next:refine`, and `/flow-next:plan` resolve the spec scaffold in this order: `<repo_root>/SPEC.md` → `<repo_root>/spec.md` → `.flow/templates/spec.md` → bundled `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/spec.md`. First match wins. The only bash path-resolution site (`flow-next-refine/SKILL.md:639`) becomes the cascade walker; the five cross-link sites in capture / interview / plan prose now reference the cascade. Snippet templates (`agents-md-snippet.md:19`, `claude-md-snippet.md:19`) updated to mention repo-root first. The bundled `templates/spec.md` `consumers:` frontmatter drops the stale `flow-next-work` entry. Case-insensitive filesystems (macOS APFS, Windows NTFS) collide `SPEC.md` / `spec.md` to a single inode — treated as a single tier-1 hit; case-sensitive FS prefers `SPEC.md` and warns when both are present.
- **`/flow-next:setup` opt-in `SPEC.md` copy step.** Step 4a (immediately after the existing `.flow/templates/spec.md` copy at `workflow.md:145`) prompts `Copy template / Skip / abort` when neither `<repo_root>/SPEC.md` nor `<repo_root>/spec.md` exists. On consent, copies the canonical template to `<repo_root>/SPEC.md` (uppercase) with a top comment noting customization location + the discovery cascade. Re-setup runs use the fn-45.3 byte-compare gate (`Keep mine / Overwrite with canonical / abort`) — with CRLF → LF normalization and trailing-newline strip before compare, since root-level files are explicitly editable.

### Deprecated
- **`planSync.crossEpic` config key.** Reading the legacy key still works in 1.x with the one-line stderr deprecation hint (suppressible via `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1`). Removed in 2.0 — matches the fn-43 `epic → spec` alias cadence (telemetry-driven, not calendar-driven; R28 forbids hard-coded sunset dates).

### Internal
- **Docs aligned with the new contract.** `plugins/flow-next/README.md:1589-1594` flips the cross-spec sync example to the canonical key with the legacy alias as a footnote; `plugins/flow-next/README.md:513-515` documents the discovery cascade + opt-in copy step in the spec template section; `plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md` config table gains a `planSync.crossSpec` row with the legacy alias footnote; `CLAUDE.md` "Creating a spec" documents the cascade via `flow-next-setup/templates/claude-md-snippet.md` (propagates to user repos on `/flow-next:setup` re-runs through the fn-45.3 byte-compare gate); `agent_docs/local-dev.md` gains "Config alias smoke" + "Repo-root SPEC.md smoke" subsections with manual verification commands.
- **Five manifest surfaces aligned at 1.1.3** via `scripts/bump.sh patch flow-next` (auto-runs `sync-codex.sh` per fn-45.4 precedent).

## [flow-next 1.1.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Codex mirror prose no longer calls `request_user_input`.** `request_user_input` errors outside Codex Plan mode (`request_user_input is unavailable in code mode` — openai/codex#10384, #11536, #12694, all closed without resolution as of Feb 2026 Codex 0.93 / GPT-5.2). fn-37's `sync-codex.sh` `AskUserQuestion` → `request_user_input` rewrite broke every interactive flow-next skill in Codex Default mode AND Codex CLI (the common case). `scripts/sync-codex.sh` Stage 3 (lines 386-517) now transforms canonical `AskUserQuestion` invocations into a plain-text numbered-prompt instruction in the Codex mirror via a Python heredoc — the agent renders options as `1.` … `N.` plus a final `N+1. Other — type your own answer` to simulate the canonical freeform input, then stops and waits for the user's next message. Hard mandates ("MUST use `AskUserQuestion`", "ONLY ask via `AskUserQuestion`") become "MUST ask via the plain-text numbered prompt described above"; auto-fix-loop anti-mandates ("Never use AskUserQuestion in this loop") survive intent-preserved with the token rewritten. Five `rui_refs` validation guards hard-fail sync if forbidden `request_user_input` patterns survive in skill **prose** (`` `request_user_input` ``, `request_user_input tool`, `request_user_input(`, `MUST use request_user_input`, `ONLY ask via request_user_input`); SKILL.md `allowed-tools:` frontmatter listings are intentional residue and out of scope (Codex reads `agents/openai.yaml` for the contract, not SKILL.md frontmatter). Behavior is uniform across Codex Default + Plan + CLI with no runtime mode detection. Canonical Claude Code prose unchanged.
- **`flow-next-setup` migration prompt now offers `abort` as an explicit option.** Pre-1.1.2 the pre-1.0 `.flow/epics/` → `.flow/specs/` migration consent prompt rendered only `Migrate now` / `Defer` / `Suppress permanently` — no clean exit path for users who wanted to inspect state before deciding. fn-45.2 added `abort — exit, leave state as-is for review` as the 4th option with explicit routing copy that acknowledges Step 1's `flowctl init` may have already run (idempotent, not rolled back). All other destructive sites (capture rewrite/supersede/override, make-pr push + PR create, audit cleanup, interview decision-record gate) audited; pre-existing `abort` / `skip` / `Don't commit` / `no` paths confirmed sufficient.
- **`flow-next-setup` preserves existing config + repo-custom docs.** Step 6d gates each `flowctl config set` on `CURRENT_*` being empty (preserve-existing-config contract documented in prose); Step 4 (`.flow/usage.md`) and Step 7 (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md marker blocks) now byte-compare against canonical and prompt `Keep / Overwrite / abort` before replacing customized content — content outside the `BEGIN/END FLOW-NEXT` markers is invariant. No silent clobber on re-run.

### Internal
- **Docs aligned with the new contract.** `CLAUDE.md` "Blocking-question tool" cross-platform row, `agent_docs/adding-skills.md` step 3 parenthetical, and `scripts/sync-codex.sh` Stage 3 comment block all describe the plain-text numbered-prompt transform. `agent_docs/local-dev.md` gains a "Codex plain-text prompt smoke" subsection with manual verification steps for Codex Desktop Default mode + Codex CLI.
- **Five manifest surfaces aligned at 1.1.2** via `scripts/bump.sh patch flow-next`.

## [flow-next 1.1.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **`install-codex.sh` now copies `templates/spec.md` (and any sibling top-level templates) to `~/.codex/templates/`.** 1.1.0 shipped the canonical spec template at `plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md` and wired the `/flow-next:refine` skill to read it at runtime via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/spec.md`, but the Codex installer only copied skill-scoped templates (ralph-init). Codex users on 1.1.0 hit a missing-file when invoking `/flow-next:refine --scope=business` on a new idea, because the NEW IDEA path resolves the template at install root. Discovered during the 1.1.0 dogfood-install check immediately post-release; patched + verified end-to-end. No Claude Code regression — Claude installs resolve `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to the plugin source tree where `templates/spec.md` always existed.

## [flow-next 1.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **`/flow-next:refine --scope=business|technical|both` — symmetric two-pass interview.** The interview skill now runs two question banks against the same spec rather than collapsing every conversation to a technical pass. `--scope=technical` (default — R22 backward-compat) asks the existing nine technical dimensions and writes to the canonical technical-owned sections (`Architecture & Data Models`, `API Contracts`, `Edge Cases & Constraints`). `--scope=business` asks the new nine-dimension business-context bank (problem framing, user persona, success outcomes, stakeholders, scope boundaries, dependencies, regulatory / compliance, business risk, decision rationale) and writes to the business-owned sections (`Goal & Context`, `Boundaries`, `Decision Context`). `--scope=both` runs the business pass first, surfaces conflicts, then runs the technical pass. R-IDs in `## Acceptance Criteria` are append-only across passes — a later pass never renumbers or replaces existing entries, only takes the next unused number. The merge contract preserves the other scope's content byte-for-byte (audited by a sync-codex.sh drift guard). The `flow-next:capture` skill now routes business signals from conversation context across the nine business dimensions and emits a one-line suggestion footer when only a fraction of the bank was filled.
- **Canonical spec template at `plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md`.** Single source of truth for `.flow/specs/<id>.md` structure — seven canonical sections (Goal & Context, Architecture & Data Models, API Contracts, Edge Cases & Constraints, Acceptance Criteria, Boundaries, Decision Context) with explicit scope-owner annotations (`<!-- scope: business -->` / `technical` / `both`) and a conditionally-substructured Decision Context (flat for technical-only passes; H3 Motivation / Implementation Tradeoffs after a business pass has run, OR under `--scope=business|both`, OR when an existing spec already has the H3s). Five consumers cross-link the template: `flow-next-capture`, `flow-next-refine`, `flow-next-plan`, `flow-next-work`, and `CLAUDE.md` — none of them duplicate the section list any more. `sync-codex.sh` carries an R21 drift guard that fails on any canonical skill markdown that duplicates the spec scaffold.
- **`questions-business.md` — nine-dimension business-context question bank.** Co-equal peer of the renamed `questions-technical.md` (formerly the singular `questions.md`). Each dimension carries the same shape: rationale, default question phrasing, deepening follow-ups, and skip semantics. Drives the `--scope=business` interview pass and the capture skill's business routing.

### Changed

- **`/flow-next:capture` routes business signals across nine destinations.** Pre-1.1.0 capture wrote conversation context into a single `## Conversation Evidence` blob and let the technical pass sort it out later. Now capture pre-classifies signals against the nine business dimensions before write, populates the business-owned canonical sections where the conversation already produced clear evidence (source-tagged `[user]` / `[paraphrase]` / `[inferred]` per criterion as before), and emits a one-line suggestion footer when fewer than ~half of the business dimensions came back filled — pointing the user at `/flow-next:refine --scope=business <spec-id>` to complete the pass. Zero-flag `flow-next:capture` invocations remain unchanged in surface behavior (R22 invariant) — only the spec markdown's section depth differs when the conversation had business signal to start with.
- **Naming fix in canonical docs: "handover #1 / #2 = the same evolving spec, not two separate documents."** `docs/teams.md` and `GLOSSARY.md` previously read as if handover #1 (PO-authored spec) and handover #2 (tech-lead spec) were two distinct artefacts; the actual semantics — and the design intent since the symmetric-interview epic — is that they are layered passes on the *same* `.flow/specs/<id>.md` file. The single-evolving-spec choice is now anchored at `STRATEGY.md` "Our approach" so future contributors hit the canonical framing first. Vs. alternative split-file approaches (e.g., Kiro's `requirements.md` / `design.md` / `tasks.md`), the single-spec layout keeps R-IDs / acceptance / architecture co-located so a downstream reviewer never has to reconstruct what each handover added.

### Internal

- **Five manifest surfaces aligned at 1.1.0.** `plugins/flow-next/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/flow-next/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (both `plugins[]` entry and `metadata.version`), and the badges in `README.md` + `plugins/flow-next/README.md` all bumped via `scripts/bump.sh minor flow-next`. `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` carries no version field — intentionally unchanged.
- **Ancillary docs point at the canonical template.** `CLAUDE.md` "Creating a spec" replaces its embedded heredoc with a pointer to `plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md` (the surrounding "Two paths" framing and `/flow-next:capture` recommendation are preserved). `plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-plan/steps.md` Step 5 cross-links the canonical scaffold before its plan-specific extensions (Overview, Quick commands, Strategy Alignment, Strategy drift, Early proof point, Requirement coverage). `plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md` `spec set-plan` section gains a one-line pointer to the template.
- **R22 backward-compat invariant.** Zero-flag invocations of `/flow-next:capture`, `/flow-next:refine`, `/flow-next:plan`, and `/flow-next:work` behave byte-identically to 1.0.2 on 1.0.2-shape specs. Verified by `tests/test_r22_zero_flag_baseline.py` in the smoke matrix.
- **R26 project-docs investigation pass.** Interview / capture skills now check for `docs/` / `agent_docs/` / `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` before asking the user about a dimension the project already documents — the host agent answers from the project docs and surfaces a "Resolved via Project Docs" appendix in the spec rather than re-asking the user.

## [flow-next 1.0.2] - 2026-05-09

### Marketplace housekeeping
- **Legacy `flow` plugin removed.** The original two-step planning + execution plugin (`plugins/flow/`) has been deleted from the marketplace; `flow-next` is now the only plugin shipped here. The legacy plugin had been unmaintained for ~10 months and never tagged a release — keeping it side-by-side with `flow-next` confused new users about which to install. Marketplace metadata (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), `scripts/install-codex.sh`, `scripts/bump.sh`, and `CLAUDE.md` updated to reference flow-next exclusively. The flow-next plugin code is unchanged from 1.0.1 — this release is purely marketplace cleanup. To browse or restore the old code: `git show 0a45aff:plugins/flow/README.md` or `git checkout 0a45aff -- plugins/flow/` (last commit on `main` containing the plugin tree).

## [flow-next 1.0.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Bare spec id (`fn-N`) resolves to slugged spec (`fn-N-slug`) across all spec-id-accepting commands.** Pre-1.0.1, `flowctl show fn-43` failed with "Spec fn-43 missing" because the resolver did literal `<id>.json` lookup — only `flowctl show fn-43-rename-epic-spec-across-flow-next` worked. The same issue silently mis-globbed `flowctl tasks --spec fn-43` and `flowctl ready --spec fn-43` to zero results. Now: when the literal file is absent and exactly one slugged file matches `<id>-*.json`, the bare form expands automatically. Multiple matches error with a disambiguation list ("Spec id 'fn-N' is ambiguous. Matches: fn-N-foo, fn-N-bar. Use the full slug."). Single canonical helper `expand_bare_spec_id` runs at the entry of every spec-id command (`show` / `cat` / `close` / `set-plan` / `set-plan-review-status` / `set-completion-review-status` / `set-backend` / `tasks --spec` / `ready --spec` / `next --spec` / `validate --spec` / `checkpoint *`). Pre-existing limitation since 0.x — not introduced in 1.0.0; surfaced and fixed during 1.0 dogfooding. (12 unit tests in `tests/test_expand_bare_spec_id.py`.)

## [flow-next 1.0.0] - 2026-05-09

### What changed
- **`flowctl epic` renamed to `flowctl spec`; `.flow/epics/` JSON sidecars relocated under `.flow/specs/` (markdown specs already lived there in 0.x); `epic-scout` renamed to `spec-scout`; `/flow-next:epic-review` renamed to `/flow-next:spec-completion-review`.** Two years of "epic spec" prose collapsed into one word — `spec` — across the entire flow-next surface. The plugin now ships epic-free: skills, commands, agents, slash-command markdown, smoke tests, internal docs, root README + plugin README + CLAUDE.md + `.flow/usage.md`, Ralph init templates, and the Codex mirror all use spec vocabulary as canonical. Worker-prompt heredoc fields renamed `EPIC_ID → SPEC_ID`; Ralph init template variable `EPICS_FILE → SPECS_FILE`; cognitive-aid payload key `epic_id → spec_id` (both surface in dual-emit during the alias window). Why now? Two reasons: (1) "epic" overloaded "release-train epic" in user vocabulary and produced cross-team friction every time a new contributor read flow-next prose; (2) flow-swarm — the planned multi-agent orchestrator — needs the `spec` lexicon as its canonical primitive, and shipping the rename in 1.0 closes the last design ambiguity before flow-swarm's first cut.

### What still works
- **All 0.x scripts and CLAUDE.md examples keep working through 1.x.** The `flowctl epic*` CLI surface stays as a deprecation alias layer that calls into canonical `cmd_specs_*` / `cmd_spec_*` entry points. `--epic` argparse flags remain accepted (alongside new `--spec`); JSON read responses dual-emit `spec_id` *and* `epic_id` so existing pipelines see both keys; on read, `.flow/epics/` is auto-fallback when `.flow/specs/` is absent. The legacy `EPIC_ID` heredoc field is still parsed by the worker prompt; the legacy `EPICS_FILE` variable is still recognized by Ralph init. Every alias path emits a one-time stderr deprecation hint pointing at the canonical CLI; suppress with `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1` (mirrors the existing `flowctl memory migrate` precedent). End result: copy-pasted CLAUDE.md examples from 0.x repos run unchanged on 1.0.0; existing `.flow/epics/` directories require zero immediate action.

### Two migration paths
- **Interactive (recommended):** `/flow-next:setup` — host agent walks the user through the migration, shows the dry-run plan, prompts for confirmation, and runs `flowctl migrate-rename --yes` on consent.
- **Deterministic (automation):** `flowctl migrate-rename --dry-run` first to preview the plan; then `flowctl migrate-rename --yes` to apply. The migration is transactional — atomic backup at `.flow/.backup-pre-1.0/`, lockfile-guarded against concurrent runs, sentinel `.flow/.migration-manifest` for idempotency, crash-recovery decision tree on every invocation. Moves the JSON sidecars `.flow/epics/<id>.json` → `.flow/specs/<id>.json` (the markdown specs already lived at `.flow/specs/<id>.md` in 0.x — only the sidecars relocate), rewrites `epic:` → `spec:` keys in `meta.json` and per-task JSON state files, removes the now-empty `.flow/epics/` directory, and stamps the post-migration sentinel `.flow/.flow_version`. End state: spec JSON + spec markdown colocated under `.flow/specs/`.

### Optional cleanup
- **Refresh your CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md prose.** Aliases keep examples working through 1.x (see Alias removal timeline below), but the deprecation banner stops nagging once your prose uses `flowctl spec` everywhere. Quick `sed` snippet:
  ```bash
  # In-place rewrite (BSD sed — macOS); GNU sed users drop the empty -i argument.
  sed -i '' \
    -e 's|flowctl epic create|flowctl spec create|g' \
    -e 's|flowctl epic set-plan|flowctl spec set-plan|g' \
    -e 's|flowctl epics|flowctl specs|g' \
    -e 's|flowctl epic |flowctl spec |g' \
    -e 's|--epic |--spec |g' \
    -e 's|\.flow/epics/|.flow/specs/|g' \
    CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
  ```
  Always commit your CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md before running this; review the diff and tweak edge cases (deprecation context, fenced-code examples that intentionally show the legacy form). A future `flowctl migrate-docs --dry-run` helper will automate this with diff-preview semantics — deferred from 1.0.0 to keep the release surface tight.

### Alias removal timeline
- **Aliases are not deprecated forever.** The current contract: aliases keep working through all of 1.x, with stderr deprecation hints (suppressible via `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1`). Soft removal target is 2.0.0 — telemetry-driven, NOT calendar-driven. We'll watch the deprecation-hint stderr counts (and direct user feedback) for the duration of 1.x; if real-world `flowctl epic` invocations have effectively zeroed out, 2.0.0 drops the alias layer. If usage stays high, the alias layer stays. R28 explicitly forbids hard-coded sunset dates — a flag day with no escape hatch is a footgun on a tool that runs in production loops.

### Rollback
- **`flowctl migrate-rollback --yes` restores the pre-1.0 layout.** The migration writes a transactional backup to `.flow/.backup-pre-1.0/` before touching anything; rollback restores from that backup, deletes `.flow/specs/` + `.flow/.migration-manifest`, and re-asserts `.flow/epics/`. Post-migration writes (new specs / task updates / done summaries authored after migrate-rename) are detected and rollback refuses by default — pass `--force-overwrite-post-migration-changes` to discard them explicitly. Lockfile-guarded so a peer migrate-rename + migrate-rollback can't race.

### Auto-managed `.flow/.gitignore`
- **`flowctl init` and `flowctl migrate-rename` now write `.flow/.gitignore`** with patterns that exclude transient migration + per-run state from version control. Auto-managed block:
  ```gitignore
  # Auto-managed by flowctl — do not edit above this marker.
  .checkpoint-*.json
  receipts/
  tmp/
  .backup-pre-1.0/
  .banner-acknowledged
  .migrating
  .migration-manifest
  # End of auto-managed block. User patterns below this line are preserved.
  ```
  Idempotent on subsequent invocations; user-added patterns below the footer are preserved on update. **Why this matters:** without it, the first `git add -A` after running `flowctl migrate-rename` would commit a multi-megabyte `.flow/.backup-pre-1.0/` directory, the per-developer `.flow/.banner-acknowledged` timestamp, and the stale `.flow/.migrating` lockfile. `.flow/.flow_version` is intentionally NOT in the auto-managed block — that's the schema sentinel and should be tracked per repo so multiple devs share the migrated state (semantics like `Cargo.lock`).

### Known issue (anthropics/claude-code#52218)
- **Claude Code's plugin auto-update may stale on bundled hook changes.** When a flow-next release ships hook-file changes (Ralph guard hooks, PreToolUse matchers), Claude Code's plugin auto-update path occasionally serves the cached pre-update hook bundle even after the manifest version bumps. Symptom: `flowctl` CLI reports 1.0.0 but Ralph guard hooks behave like 0.42.0. Workaround: run `/plugin update flow-next` manually once after upgrading; this forces a hot-reload of the bundled hook bundle. Tracking upstream: anthropics/claude-code#52218. Codex (`scripts/install-codex.sh flow-next`) and Factory Droid plugin paths are unaffected — only the Claude Code marketplace auto-update path exhibits this behavior.

### Notes
- **Why `spec` and not `epic-spec` / `feature-spec` / `plan`?** Single-word primitives compose better in CLI grammar. `flowctl spec create` reads cleanly; `flowctl epic-spec create` reads as if there's an unspoken `epic` parent. The shorter form also matches GitHub's `gh pr create` / `gh issue create` cadence — the rename brings flow-next in line with the existing CLI lexicon users already have in muscle memory.
- **Why a major bump?** Renaming the canonical CLI surface and the on-disk directory layout is a breaking-change-shaped event even when aliases preserve every behavior. Semver says: don't surprise people. 1.0.0 is also a deliberate signal — flow-next has been production-stable since the 0.30.0 era; the version number was holding the ecosystem back from treating it as a 1.x dependency. Both motivations align.
- **Why dual-emit JSON instead of a hard cutover?** Dual-emit lets downstream tooling (the future flow-swarm orchestrator, third-party integrators reading flowctl JSON output) migrate at their own cadence inside the 1.x window. JSON consumers reading `epic_id` keep working; consumers reading `spec_id` see the new canonical key from day one. The dual-emit overhead is two extra dictionary entries per response — measured cost, not theoretical.

## [flow-next 0.42.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **`/flow-next:make-pr` — PR-as-cognitive-aid skill.** New eighteenth slash command closes the gap between "all tasks done" and "human reviews the PR." Five phases (pre-flight → gather → build body → mermaid → push + create) render a reviewable PR body from rich flow-next state: epic spec with R-IDs, per-task `done_summary` + evidence commits, `decisions` / bug / `architecture-patterns` memory, glossary changes, strategy alignment, deferred review findings, and the diff itself. Body sections include TL;DR, R-ID coverage table (R# → satisfying task → evidence commit), Critical changes (high-churn / cross-module / public-interface / security-sensitive / behavior-visible), Decisions, Memory references, Glossary/strategy deltas, Open items, and Where to look (reviewer-focus list). Default `--draft` if open items > 0 or under Ralph; `--ready` overrides. Uses `gh pr create --body-file` (NOT heredoc — LLM-generated markdown frequently contains characters that break heredocs and shell interpolation). NOT Ralph-blocked — PR creation is the autonomous-loop terminus, and Ralph defaults to `--draft` for human review. NO cross-model review of the PR body — each harness's own model identifies critical changes from the structured input; `/flow-next:impl-review` already covers the *code itself*, so reviewing the description too is double-counting.
- **Mermaid codefences when diff crosses module boundaries.** Skill emits up to 3 diagrams × 12 nodes (hard caps) when changes touch ≥2 modules. Markdown codefences only — GitHub / GitLab / Gitea render natively, no external rendering pipeline. `mermaid-rules.md` ref file documents reserved words, escape patterns, shape selection, and the pre-emission validation checklist. Disable via `--no-mermaid`.
- **`flowctl epic export-cognitive-aid <epic-id> --base <ref> --json` plumbing.** New deterministic flowctl subcommand aggregates 9 input streams (epic spec, tasks + done summaries + evidence, R-ID coverage, decisions / bug / architecture-patterns memory, glossary deltas, strategy alignment, deferred review findings, diff stats) into a single structured JSON payload. Reusable from skills + scripts; the skill consumes it as the single source of truth for body rendering.
- **Smoke test `plugins/flow-next/scripts/make-pr_smoke_test.sh`** covering `export-cognitive-aid` JSON shape + body-rendering invariants + `--dry-run` (no push, no `gh pr create`).
- **Codex sync regenerated.** New `flow-next-make-pr` `openai.yaml` entry (workflow tier, brand color `#3B82F6`); `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` array updated. Canonical skill files use Claude-native `AskUserQuestion`; `sync-codex.sh` rewrites to `request_user_input` for the Codex mirror per repo convention.

### Notes
- **Why PR-as-cognitive-aid?** The framing comes from a simple observation: don't ask a human to skim a 10K-line diff — ask the agent to make those 10K lines reviewable. The PR body itself is the artefact that lets a reviewer decide *where to focus* before opening any file. flow-next already collects every input that body needs — this skill stitches them.
- **Why no cross-model review of the body?** Each harness (Claude Code, Codex, Droid) is competent at "what looks important here?" given the rich structured input. `/flow-next:impl-review` already covers the *code itself*; running a second review on the description would be double-counting and inflate latency for no gain.
- **Why NOT Ralph-blocked?** PR creation is the natural autonomous-loop terminus — Ralph just opened a draft PR for human review. Ralph defaults to `--draft` (human reviews on their cadence; `/flow-next:resolve-pr` handles the response loop after).
- **Why `--body-file` not heredoc?** LLM-generated markdown frequently contains backticks, `$`, dollar-paren, and other shell-interpolation characters that mangle heredoc-passed strings. `gh pr create --body-file <path>` reads bytes verbatim from disk.

## [flow-next 0.41.1] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- **Codex subagent default model bumped `gpt-5.4` → `gpt-5.5`.** The 11 intelligent subagents (opus-tier + smart-sonnet-tier in the Claude Code mapping) now use `gpt-5.5` in their pre-built tomls. The 8 fast scouts stay on `gpt-5.4-mini` (mini doesn't support reasoning tiers; no value in bumping). `worker` and `pr-comment-resolver` continue inheriting from parent. `flowctl.py`'s review-backend default was already `gpt-5.5:high` (lines 2632 / 2661) — this change closes the gap between subagent and review-backend defaults.
- **Per-agent reasoning effort split: `quality-auditor` stays at `high`; all other intelligent subagents drop to `medium`.** `quality-auditor` is review-shaped (a second pair of eyes on uncommitted changes) — undershooting risks missed regressions. Scout / editorial agents (10 of them) run efficiently at `medium`. New env vars `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` (default `medium`) and `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT_AUDITOR` (default `high`) override per tier; new helper `reasoning_effort_for(<agent>)` in `sync-codex.sh` dispatches per-agent. The actual review backend (`flowctl impl-review` / `plan-review` / `completion-review`) is configured separately and unaffected — it remains at `gpt-5.5:high` via `flowctl.py`.
- **Doc updates.** `CLAUDE.md` model-mapping table reformatted to a 5-row tier with explicit per-agent reasoning column; example `codex:gpt-5.4:xhigh` spec-form examples updated to `codex:gpt-5.5:xhigh`. `plugins/flow-next/README.md` model-mapping section updated to match. Registry catalog rows (`gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.2`, ...) preserved — `gpt-5.4` remains a valid catalog model, just not the subagent default.

## [flow-next 0.41.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **CI smoke matrix expanded to 7 suites on ubuntu / macos / windows.** Beyond `ci_test.sh` (already in matrix), the workflow now runs `resolve-pr_smoke_test.sh`, `strategy_smoke_test.sh`, `audit_smoke_test.sh`, `glossary_smoke_test.sh`, `prospect_smoke_test.sh`, `impl-review_smoke_test.sh`, and `smoke_test.sh` on each OS leg. ~596 assertions per leg, ~260s runtime, matrix wall time ~4 min. `fail-fast: false` so one OS failure no longer cancels the others; `defaults.run.shell: bash` unifies the matrix; `if: always()` on each smoke step ensures full diagnostic in one run. Skipped: `ralph_smoke_test.sh`, `ralph_smoke_rp.sh`, `plan_review_prompt_smoke.sh` — need external CLIs (claude / codex / rp-cli) not on hosted runners.

### Fixed
- **`atomic_write` no longer silently translates LF → CRLF on Windows.** Python's text-mode default `newline=None` on the `os.fdopen` inside `atomic_write` translates `\n` to `os.linesep` (`\r\n` on Windows). Every flowctl-written file (memory entries, glossary entries, prospect artifacts, `STRATEGY.md`, epic/task specs) ended up with CRLF on Windows checkouts, causing phantom "modified" diffs in cross-OS git checkouts and round-trip byte-comparison failures. Fix: pass `newline=""` so on-disk content matches the LF line endings flow-next writes everywhere.
- **`flowctl glossary add --definition-file -` normalizes CRLF/CR to LF on stdin.** Bash on Windows (Git Bash / MSYS) writes CRLF to pipes by default; Python's text-mode stdin universal-newlines didn't always fire when the parent opened the pipe in binary mode. Result: glossary `--definition-file -` stored multi-line definitions with CRLF instead of LF on Windows, breaking byte-equal round-trip comparisons. Defensive `.replace('\r\n', '\n').replace('\r', '\n')` runs immediately after `sys.stdin.read()`.
- **`_prospect_parse_frontmatter` coerces typed booleans in the no-PyYAML fallback path.** `_parse_inline_yaml` deliberately keeps booleans as strings (memory entries don't need typed scalars), but prospect frontmatter ships typed booleans (`floor_violation`, `generation_under_volume`) that `validate_prospect_frontmatter` and downstream consumers expect as `bool`. Without PyYAML installed, `parsed["floor_violation"] is True` evaluated `False` even when the serialized value was `floor_violation: true`. Fallback now post-coerces those two prospect-specific keys.
- **Multiple Windows-portability fixes across smoke tests.** `TEST_DIR` now honors `$TEST_DIR` env override, falls back through `$RUNNER_TEMP` → `$TMPDIR` → `/tmp`; backslashes are normalized to forward slashes after expansion (Python on Windows accepts forward-slash paths and is corrupted when bash interpolates `D:\a\_temp` into Python source — `\a` is bell). `SCRIPT_DIR` and `PLUGIN_ROOT` get `cygpath -m` conversion on Windows so `import flowctl` from inline Python resolves. `assert_grep` rewritten to use here-strings (no `printf | grep` SIGPIPE under `pipefail` when `grep -q` exits early on a found match in a large haystack). `json_get` strips `\r` from output (Python's `print()` text-mode stdout translates internal `\n` in JSON values to `\r\n` on Windows). Em-dashes in strategy fixtures replaced with `--` (Git Bash + cp1252 locale wrote em-dashes as cp1252 single-byte). Strategy T10 subprocess calls use `[sys.executable, FLOWCTL_PY, ...]` instead of `[FLOWCTL]` (the bash wrapper isn't a valid Win32 exe). Ralph-regression sweeps in prospect Case 11 + impl-review skip on `$RUNNER_OS=Windows` (ralph_smoke embeds POSIX patterns; the regression check tests prospect/impl-review env-var handling, unrelated to ralph's Windows portability).

### CI workflow
- `core.autocrlf=false` step before `actions/checkout@v4` so heredoc and fixture line endings are preserved as LF on Windows runners (default Windows-runner config converts LF → CRLF, mangling content compared byte-identically by smokes).
- `git config --global user.email/name` before tests (smoke_test.sh exercises `git commit` flows; runners ship git without identity → "fatal: empty ident name").

## [flow-next 0.40.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **`/flow-next:strategy [optional: section to revisit]` — agent-native repo strategy anchor.** New skill that writes/maintains a repo-root `STRATEGY.md` (peer of `GLOSSARY.md` / `README.md`, never under `.flow/`) so strategic intent survives `rm -rf .flow/` (R1 / R22 — survives uninstall by design, mirrors the glossary R18 invariant). Section structure derived from Richard Rumelt's strategy kernel (*Good Strategy Bad Strategy*: diagnosis / guiding policy / coherent action), extended with persona + metrics for repo-doc utility: 5 required sections (`Target problem` / `Our approach` / `Who it's for` / `Key metrics` / `Tracks`) plus 2 optional (`Milestones` / `Not working on`). A `Marketing` section was considered and dropped — over-rotated for OSS-tools repos. Atomic per-section writes; `last_updated` bumps on every save. No draft state file. Re-invocation reads existing sections via `flowctl strategy status` and asks which section to revisit. Pushback discipline: 2 rounds maximum per section, then captures what user gave with a `<!-- worth revisiting -->` comment. Anti-pattern labels (vanity / fluff / feature-list) NOT leaked to user — only used internally to formulate sharper follow-up questions; quote user's own words back when challenging.
- **Repo-root `STRATEGY.md` artifact.** Frontmatter holds 3 keys only: `name`, `last_updated`, `generator: flow-next-strategy`. Foreign-file refusal — without the `generator: flow-next-strategy` sentinel the skill prompts the user (migrate / keep / rewrite?). Multi-format migration (CE-format / hand-written) explicitly deferred to v2; v1 ships the sentinel + refusal. Plain GFM markdown only; no MDX / admonitions / `:::tip` blocks.
- **`flowctl strategy status / read / list` plumbing.** `flowctl strategy status [--json]` returns `{exists, husk, sections_filled, total_sections, last_updated, file_path}`. Husk definition: file exists but `sections_filled == 0`. `flowctl strategy read [--section <name>] [--json]` resolves the repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and checks for `STRATEGY.md` ONLY at that root — single-root resolution, no upward walk, no cascade. An `apps/web/STRATEGY.md` is always ignored; downstream skills consume the repo-root file regardless of cwd. Strategy is repo-wide by Rumelt's definition (NOT nearest-ancestor like glossary). `flowctl strategy list [--json]` parallels `flowctl glossary list` for symmetric downstream iteration. NO `flowctl strategy add/edit/remove` — strategy is too prose-heavy for atomic field-set CLI; the skill IS the editor.
- **Doc-aware autodetect — third condition.** Doc-aware mode now activates when ANY of three signals: `glossary.total_terms > 0` OR `knowledge/decisions/` has entries OR `strategy.sections_filled >= 1`. Override flags follow a cascade-with-explicit-override rule: `--docs` / `--no-docs` cascade to all three categories (glossary + decisions + strategy); explicit `--strategy` / `--no-strategy` always wins over the cascade for the strategy slot. 5-row matrix: `(default)` autodetect all three; `--docs` on for all three; `--no-docs` off for all three; `--no-docs --strategy` strategy on / glossary+decisions off; `--docs --no-strategy` glossary+decisions on / strategy off. Husk semantics on autodetect: branches on `flowctl strategy status --json | jq '.sections_filled >= 1'`, NOT on `[[ -f STRATEGY.md ]]` — same trap glossary fell into.
- **Strategy-doc fluff guard (R19).** New guard block in `plugins/flow-next/scripts/ci_test.sh` (separate from R17 DDD section 5c — comment specifies "strategy-doc fluff guard, NOT R17"). Tier 1 jargon only (Rumelt's "fluff" hallmarks): `synergy / pivot / disrupt / thought-leadership / best-in-class / world-class / 10x`. Scoped to `plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-strategy/SKILL.md` + `cmd_strategy_*` regions in `flowctl.py` + `plugins/flow-next/commands/flow-next/strategy.md`. The `references/interview.md` file is excluded — must describe anti-patterns to push back on them (same exemption as glossary references). Mirrored in `scripts/sync-codex.sh` validation block for the Codex mirror at `plugins/flow-next/codex/skills/flow-next-strategy/`. Two-tier guard (canonical + mirror) catches violations at either source path.
- **Smoke test `plugins/flow-next/scripts/strategy_smoke_test.sh` (T1-T12).** Cases: T1 first-run create-from-scratch; T2 targeted section re-run preserves rest byte-identically; T3 subdirectory invocation walks up; T4 husk detected via `sections_filled == 0`; T5 foreign-file refusal (no `generator` sentinel); T6 mid-flow abandonment + resume; T7 forbidden-vocab pushback; T8 strategy-glossary conflict surfaces in interview spec; T9 capture `--override-strategy` writes decision record; T10 prospect grounding emits verbatim approach + tracks; T11 plan-sync drift surfacing read-only; T12 Ralph-block exit-2.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:prospect` Phase 0 grounding scan reads `STRATEGY.md`** when `sections_filled >= 1`. Injects approach + active tracks verbatim into candidate-generation prompt (mirrors CE-ideate's "emit approach and active tracks verbatim" pattern). Adds `out-of-scope-vs-strategy` to the rejection taxonomy. Surfaced as advisory at prospect phase — never auto-rejects.
- **`/flow-next:plan` research scan reads `STRATEGY.md`.** Plan emits a `## Strategy Alignment` spec section listing which active tracks the plan serves. Drift surfaced as a `## Strategy drift flagged for review` block (read-only — never auto-supersedes; mirrors decision-record convention).
- **`/flow-next:refine` doc-aware mode reads `STRATEGY.md`** before terminology questions. Surfaces conflicts in a `## Strategy Conflicts` spec section parallel to existing `## Glossary Conflicts`. Throttle: ≤1 strategy-conflict question per interview turn (parallel to the existing glossary-question throttle). Behavior (e) added — code-versus-strategy contradiction.
- **`/flow-next:capture` Phase 0 reads `STRATEGY.md` as input.** Source-tags strategy-derived acceptance criteria as `[strategy:<track-name>]` (joins existing `[user]` / `[paraphrase]` / `[inferred]` tags). Refuses to write spec contradicting an active track without `--override-strategy` flag. On flag fire: prompts user via `AskUserQuestion` to record a decision via `flowctl memory add --track knowledge --category decisions ...` (recommendation: yes; user can decline). Audit trail captured to stderr for future review.
- **`/flow-next:sync` (plan-sync agent) Step 5 reads `STRATEGY.md`.** Surfaces drift in a `## Strategy drift flagged for review` spec heading parallel to existing "Decision overrides flagged for review". NEVER auto-supersedes — read-only surface only. Track renames replace inline with a `<!-- Updated by plan-sync: track rename ... -->` breadcrumb mirroring the existing glossary rename pattern.
- **Codex sync regenerated.** New `flow-next-strategy` openai.yaml entry (`Flow Strategy`, brand color `#3B82F6`); `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` array updated to include the new skill. Canonical skill files use Claude-native `AskUserQuestion`; `sync-codex.sh` rewrites to `request_user_input` for the Codex mirror per repo convention.

### Constraints
- **R1 — `STRATEGY.md` lives at the repo root.** Peer of `GLOSSARY.md` / `README.md`, never under `.flow/`. Survives a wipe of `.flow/` (R22 / R18 invariant). Frontmatter contains `name`, `last_updated`, `generator: flow-next-strategy` only.
- **R2 — Section structure locked.** 5 required + 2 optional, in CE 3.4's verbatim order. Optional sections deleted entirely if unused; never left as empty headers. Last-section deletion leaves a husk (H1 + frontmatter) — file never deleted (R23).
- **R7 — Single-root walk.** `flowctl strategy *` walks UP from cwd to first `STRATEGY.md` found, capped at repo root. NOT nearest-ancestor like glossary. Subdirectory invocation surfaces "Using repo-root STRATEGY.md at <path>" before any interview question (R16).
- **R15 — Foreign-file refusal.** STRATEGY.md without `generator: flow-next-strategy` frontmatter routes via `AskUserQuestion` (migrate / keep / rewrite?). On "keep" — exits without writing. v1 explicitly defers automatic migration.
- **R17 — Ralph-block.** `/flow-next:strategy` exits 2 with stderr `[STRATEGY: user-triggered only — Ralph cannot run /flow-next:strategy]` when `FLOW_RALPH=1` or `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` is set. Mirrors the `/flow-next:prospect` and `/flow-next:capture` precedent.
- **R19 — Tier 1 forbidden-vocab guard.** Separate from R17 DDD guard. `references/interview.md` excluded so it can describe anti-patterns. Two-tier (canonical + Codex mirror).

### Smoke coverage
- `strategy_smoke_test.sh` (T1-T12) covers happy path + corner cases listed above.
- `ci_test.sh` (R19 canonical) gates `SKILL.md` + `commands/flow-next/strategy.md` + `cmd_strategy_*` regions of `flowctl.py`.
- `scripts/sync-codex.sh` validation block (R19 mirror) gates `plugins/flow-next/codex/skills/flow-next-strategy/`.
- Glossary smoke (`glossary_smoke_test.sh`) and `smoke_test.sh` stay green; `audit_smoke_test.sh` and `prospect_smoke_test.sh` unchanged.

### Notes
- **Why repo-root STRATEGY.md, not `.flow/strategy.md`?** Survives a wipe of `.flow/`; peer of `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `GLOSSARY.md`; generic markdown tooling reads it. R18 invariant established by 0.39.0 glossary epic; the same rationale applies — strategic intent belongs to the project, not to flow-next.
- **Why single-root, NOT nearest-ancestor walk like glossary?** Strategy is repo-wide by Rumelt's definition (one diagnosis, one guiding policy, coherent action). Cascading per-subdirectory STRATEGY.md files re-introduce the "is for everyone, is for no one" problem the skill exists to prevent. Glossary cascades because vocabulary is local; strategy is global.
- **Why drop CE's `Marketing` section?** Over-rotated for OSS-tools repos — the marketplace manifest IS the distribution surface. Adding sections has cost; CE's principle 3 ("Short is a feature") supports the cut.
- **Why no `flowctl strategy add` plumbing?** Strategy is too prose-heavy for atomic field-set CLI. The skill running the interview IS the LLM that should write the file (per CLAUDE.md "agentic vs deterministic" architecture rule). Atomic CLI plumbing fits term-list / decision-record / memory shape but not prose-heavy strategy shape.
- **Why Tier 1 fluff vocab only (drop the `leverage` verb)?** Rumelt's source uses "leverage" as a noun in *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* — false-positive risk too high for `references/learn-more.md` prose. Tier 1 list is unambiguous.
- **Why foreign-file refusal in v1 (no migration)?** CE-format and hand-written `STRATEGY.md` files have ambiguous section mappings. Multi-format migration is a v2 problem; v1 ships the sentinel + refusal pattern, documents the limitation, lets early adopters delete-or-rename to bootstrap.

## [flow-next 0.39.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`GLOSSARY.md` artifact + `flowctl glossary` subcommands.** New first-class human-readable glossary that lives at the repo root (and optional subdirectories) so the project's canonical names + term-conflict resolutions survive `rm -rf .flow/` (R18). H2-per-term markdown format aligns with `open-gitops/documents` and `glossarify-md`. Resolution is nearest-ancestor-walk from cwd up to repo root (first match wins; same shape as `tsconfig.json` / EditorConfig discovery), capped at 32 levels with cycle detection. Subcommands: `flowctl glossary add <term> [--definition ... | --definition-file FILE | -] [--avoid a,b,c] [--relates-to x,y] [--json]` upserts case-insensitively; `glossary list [--json]` returns `{groups: [{path, entries, count}], file_count, total_terms}` grouped by file (nearest first); `glossary read <term> [--json]` walks ancestors and returns `{path, term, definition, avoid, relates_to}`; `glossary remove <term> [--json]` removes from the file that defines it. Last-term `remove` leaves a `# Glossary` H1 husk on disk — never deletes the file (R18). New helper functions `find_nearest_glossary` / `find_all_glossaries` / `parse_glossary_file` / `render_glossary_file` / `validate_glossary_entry` / `_glossary_term_matches` / `_glossary_strip_fenced_code` and constants `GLOSSARY_FILE` / `GLOSSARY_WALK_MAX_DEPTH` are reusable from downstream skills via the subcommands rather than direct imports.
- **`knowledge/decisions/` memory category + decision-specific frontmatter fields.** New category alongside `architecture-patterns`, `conventions`, `tooling-decisions`, `workflow`, `best-practices`. Three optional frontmatter fields permitted on any knowledge entry but specifically intended for `decisions/` entries: `decision_status` (enum: `proposed | accepted | superseded`), `superseded_by` (id reference), `alternatives_considered` (free-form prose). Schema constants exposed: `MEMORY_DECISION_FIELDS` (frozenset) and `MEMORY_DECISION_STATUSES` (enum tuple) live alongside the existing `MEMORY_KNOWLEDGE_FIELDS` / `MEMORY_STATUS` constants. Body convention: 1–3 sentence floor describing trade-offs, irreversibility, and surprise factor. Validator picks up additions automatically via the allowed-fields union.
- **`/flow-next:refine` doc-aware mode.** New autodetect: if `GLOSSARY.md` exists at any ancestor (with at least one term — husks are skipped) or `knowledge/decisions/` has at least one entry, the interview enters doc-aware mode. Override via `--docs` (force on) / `--no-docs` (force off). Four behaviors when active: (a) **glossary lookup before terminology questions** — fetch nearest-ancestor canonical wording via `flowctl glossary read`; surface conflicts as a `## Glossary Conflicts` section in the refined spec when user wording diverges from canonical, with resolution outcome (use-canonical / update-glossary / accept-divergence); (b) **inline glossary write on resolution** — `flowctl glossary add` invoked when the user picks update-glossary, recording the new canonical term; (c) **decision-record awareness** — when a load-bearing architectural choice is made during interview, prompt to write a `knowledge/decisions/` entry with the three-criteria gate (hard-to-reverse / surprising / load-bearing trade-off) and read-back loop before write; (d) **code/spec contradiction surfaced** — when an interview answer conflicts with an active decision record, the contradiction is surfaced in the refined spec rather than silently overwriting either side. The new `## Glossary Conflicts` template section sits alongside the existing `## Resolved via Codebase` section as the audit trail for canonical-vs-user wording resolutions; both are written by `NEW-IDEA` and `EXISTING-EPIC` interview templates.

### Changed
- **`docs-gap-scout` extends planning-phase scan.** Scout now reads `GLOSSARY.md` at repo root (and walked ancestors when planning a subdirectory feature) plus `.flow/memory/knowledge/decisions/` to surface canonical terminology and prior load-bearing choices in the planning context. Planning-phase output flags terminology mismatches between the proposed feature description and the glossary, and lists relevant decision records the plan should respect. No new acceptance criteria are auto-added — surfaced findings flow into `/flow-next:plan` for human / planner judgment.
- **`/flow-next:audit` walks glossary terms + decision entries.** Phase 0.5 (new) reads every `GLOSSARY.md` on the ancestor chain and audits each term against the current code (any references intact? renamed? gone?). Phase 0.1 (extended) auto-walks `knowledge/decisions/` alongside other categories. Replace outcomes for decision entries are **supersede-not-delete** — the audit writes a new entry with `decision_status: accepted` and sets the old entry's `decision_status: superseded` + `superseded_by: <new-id>`, preserving the historical trail. Other categories keep the existing Replace semantics.
- **`/flow-next:sync` detects glossary renames + flags decision overrides.** Phase 3b extends the drift sweep: **3b.1** glossary renames replace `_Avoid_` aliases with the canonical term across downstream task specs (additive — old wording is replaced inline with a `<!-- Updated by plan-sync: glossary rename ... -->` breadcrumb); **3b.2** decision overrides surface read-only under a "Decision overrides flagged for review" heading in the affected task specs. Sync **never auto-supersedes** decision records — superseding is a human-judgment / audit-driven action. Husk and superseded entries are skipped (no work to do; the file_count == 0 OR total_terms == 0 short-circuit prevents false positives). The read-only contract on decisions matches the broader principle that automated drift sweeps should not silently rewrite explicit historical choices.
- **Two-tier R17 + R4 grep guard added to CI.** Canonical scan in `plugins/flow-next/scripts/ci_test.sh` section 5c covers `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, and `flowctl.py`; matches print `file:line` for fast remediation. Mirror scan in `scripts/sync-codex.sh` validation block covers `plugins/flow-next/codex/`; matches print a count plus a remediation hint pointing back at the canonical guard. R17 enforces the forbidden-vocabulary list (intentionally only listed inline inside the grep pattern itself; documentation refers to "the R17 forbidden list" without enumeration); R4 forbids early-design meta-file names (`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`) leaking into canonical or mirrored prose.

### Notes
- **Foundations.** Builds on closed epics fn-30 (categorized memory schema), fn-34 (`/flow-next:audit`), fn-36 (capture + interview grill-me patterns), and the fn-15-96t plan-sync infrastructure. The `decisions/` category extends fn-30's schema additively; the doc-aware interview mode threads through fn-36's lead-with-recommendation + codebase-before-asking patterns; audit + sync extensions reuse fn-34's walk-and-decide framing.
- **R18 — survives uninstall by design.** `GLOSSARY.md` lives at the repo root, NOT inside `.flow/`. Deleting `.flow/` removes task tracking + memory + prospects, but the project's canonical wording stays put. This is a tenet, not an accident: terminology is the project's, not flow-next's.
- **Read-only sync contract.** Plan-sync's decision-override flagging is deliberately read-only. Auto-supersede would be a footgun: the agent might supersede an active decision based on a single conflicting task spec, losing the historical trail. Surface and let the human decide.
- **Smoke coverage:** `glossary_smoke_test.sh` (T2) covers parse / round-trip / nearest-ancestor walk / husk-on-last-remove / 80 assertions. `ci_test.sh` section 5c (R17 + R4 canonical) and `scripts/sync-codex.sh` validation block (R17 + R4 mirror) gate canonical and Codex-mirror prose hygiene.

## [flow-next 0.38.3] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **`plugins/flow-next/docs/flowctl.md` refreshed.** Authoritative CLI reference (linked from `.flow/usage.md`) had drifted since 0.33.0 — missing entire subcommand families introduced across 0.33–0.38. Added sections: `review-backend` (0.31.0+ spec grammar), `prospect` family (`list` / `read` / `promote` / `archive`, 0.36.0), `triage-skip` (0.35.0), `ralph` run control (`pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `status`), `copilot` review backend (parallel to `codex`), `codex deep-pass` + `codex validate` (fn-32.1/2), `review-deep-auto`, `review-walkthrough-defer`, `review-walkthrough-record` (fn-32.3 helpers). Memory section rewritten for the categorized YAML schema (0.33.0+): `--track bug|knowledge --category C` syntax, track-specific fields, `--status active|stale|all` filter, plus new subcommands `mark-stale`, `mark-fresh`, `migrate` (with deprecation pointer to `/flow-next:memory-migrate`), `list-legacy`, `discoverability-patch`. Updated available-commands list at the top of the file. Pure docs — no behavior change.

## [flow-next 0.38.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **`flowctl.py` subprocess calls now pin `encoding="utf-8"` instead of defaulting to the system locale.** On Windows, `subprocess.run(input=prompt, text=True, ...)` decodes through `locale.getencoding()` — which is **cp1252** by default — so any prompt containing characters outside the cp1252 range (Unicode in git diffs, prototype/documentation files, non-ASCII commit messages) raised `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters ...`. Setting `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` did not help because `subprocess.run` ignores stdio encoding env vars. Fixed by adding `encoding="utf-8"` to all 25 `text=True` subprocess invocations in `flowctl.py`, covering `run_codex_exec()`, `run_copilot_exec()`, `run_rp_cli()`, every git plumbing call (`git diff`, `git rev-parse`, `git config`), and review-backend dispatch. No-op on macOS/Linux (already UTF-8 by default); fixes Windows. Smoke (129) green.

### Notes
- Thanks to @evansmith-everag (Evan Smith) for the detailed report ([#123](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/123)) — root-caused, reproducer, fix, AND flagged the broader class of issue ("other subprocess calls in the file may have the same issue if they ever receive Unicode input") in one shot.

## [flow-next 0.38.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **`scripts/install-codex.sh` no longer writes a duplicate `[features]` TOML table.** Pre-fix versions appended a standalone `[features]\ncodex_hooks = true` block to `~/.codex/config.toml` even when an existing `[features]` table was already present (Codex's own defaults ship one). TOML disallows duplicate tables — Codex 0.125.0 hard-errors on parse with `duplicate key`, breaking every Codex invocation post-install. Script now uses a portable awk merge: detects existing `[features]` block, inserts `codex_hooks = true  # flow-next` after the header (idempotent — skipped if already present); falls back to creating a fresh block when none exists. Migration: legacy `# --- flow-next features ---` markers are still cleaned before the merge, so re-running the new script over a previously-broken config heals it in one pass.

### Changed
- **Codex install: single documented path is now `git clone + ./scripts/install-codex.sh flow-next`.** The native `/plugins` install (both `cd flow-next && codex` → `/plugins` and `codex plugin marketplace add gmickel/flow-next` → `/plugins`) is no longer documented because Codex's plugin manifest schema (as of April 2026) supports `skills`, `mcpServers`, `apps` but not `agents`, `hooks`, or `commands`. Both `/plugins` paths register the slash commands but skip the bundled 21 `.toml` agents and `hooks.json` — breaking subagent isolation (worker model tier, `disallowed_tools` enforcement) and Ralph hooks. The script merges everything into `~/.codex/config.toml` directly. Idempotent — re-run after every `git pull` to update.
- **README.md (root, plugin), CLAUDE.md** rewritten to reflect single-path Codex install with rationale paragraph. Recheck note in `CLAUDE.md` ties the docs decision to a concrete trigger: revisit when Codex changelog mentions plugin manifest fields or app-server plugin management; once `agents` + `hooks` land in the schema, drop the script and document `codex plugin marketplace add gmickel/flow-next` instead.

### Notes
- No skill, agent, command, or flowctl behavior changes. Pure install-path + script-bug fix.

## [flow-next 0.38.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`/flow-next:capture [mode:autofix] [--rewrite <id>] [--from-compacted-ok] [--yes]` — agent-native conversation → epic spec.** New skill that synthesizes the current conversation context into a flow-next epic spec at `.flow/specs/<epic-id>.md` via existing `flowctl epic create + epic set-plan` plumbing. No new flowctl subcommands. Sits between free-form discussion (or `/flow-next:prospect` artifact promotion) and the formal `/flow-next:plan` task breakout, replacing the manual `flowctl epic create + set-plan` heredoc documented in `CLAUDE.md` for any spec emerging from conversation. Adapted from upstream `to-prd`; flow-next-shaped (output to `.flow/specs/`, not GitHub issue). Host agent does the synthesis directly — no Python synthesizer, no codex / copilot subprocess.
- **Hard guardrails:** source-tagged acceptance criteria (`[user]` = verbatim from conversation, `[paraphrase]` = user intent restated, `[inferred]` = agent fill-in, most-scrutinized at read-back); mandatory read-back loop (full draft + `[inferred]` count via `AskUserQuestion`, even in autofix mode where `--yes` is required to commit); duplicate-epic detection (Phase 0 scans `.flow/epics/` + runs `flowctl memory search` on extracted keywords); compaction detection (refuses without `--from-compacted-ok` when conversation has truncation markers); idempotency-via-`--rewrite` (refuses to overwrite an existing spec without explicit opt-in); must-ask cases (ambiguous title / untestable acceptance / scope-conflict are hard-error conditions, not soft preferences); "consider splitting?" suggestion at 8+ acceptance criteria (never auto-splits — user decides). CLAUDE.md richer template (`Goal & Context` / `Architecture` / `API Contracts` / `Edge Cases` / `Acceptance Criteria` / `Boundaries` / `Decision Context`); R-IDs allocated sequentially from R1.
- **Workflow position:** capture is **upstream of** `interview` and `plan`, **downstream of** free-form discussion or `/flow-next:prospect` promotion. The `/flow-next:prospect` direct-to-`plan` path (via `flowctl prospect promote`) still works unchanged. New pathways supported: `free-form → capture → plan`, `free-form → capture → interview → plan`, `prospect → capture → plan`, `prospect → capture → interview → plan`. All terminate at `work`.

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:refine` enhanced with three patterns from upstream `grill-me`.** (a) **Lead-with-recommendation** — every `AskUserQuestion` body now includes options summary, recommended option, one-sentence rationale, and a confidence tier (`[high]` / `[judgment-call]` / `[your-call]`). The third tier breaks the always-recommend habit when the agent has no signal. (b) **Pre-question taxonomy** — codebase-answerable questions ("what exists / how wired / what conventions") are investigated via Read/Grep/Glob and logged to a new `## Resolved via Codebase` spec section; user-judgment-required questions ("what should / what tradeoff / what priority") go to `AskUserQuestion`. Eliminates wasteful "should we use PostgreSQL?" questions when grep can answer "is there already a DB layer?". (c) **Dependency-ordered branch walk** — depth cap of 4, discover-as-you-go (not pre-compute), abandoned branches are surfaced ("Skipping persistence questions — you said no DB"). One-question-per-turn invariant reaffirmed.
- **Workflow ladder docs (root README + plugin README + CLAUDE.md + website FAQ)** updated to reflect all spec-diagram pathways: `prospect → plan` (direct via promote), `prospect → capture → interview/plan`, `free-form → capture → interview/plan`, plus the existing `interview-first` / `plan-first` / `work-direct` rows.
- **Plugin README mermaid lifecycle diagram** extended with a capture node showing all three entry points (prospect-promote, free-form, direct) and both downstream branches (interview, plan).
- **Plugin README "Prospect vs Spec vs Interview vs Plan" explainer** extended with a Capture entry positioning it as the automated alternative to manual `flowctl epic create + epic set-plan`, with read-back guarantees.

### Notes
- **Capture is Ralph-blocked by default.** Requires conversation context + user confirmation; both unavailable in autonomous loops. Hard-errors with exit 2 under `FLOW_RALPH=1` or `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` (matches `/flow-next:prospect` and `/flow-next:resolve-pr`).
- **Capture is the automated alternative** to the manual `flowctl epic create + epic set-plan` heredoc documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Both paths supported. Capture is recommended for any spec emerging from conversation; the manual path is still useful for scripted callers.
- **Why a new skill instead of extending `/flow-next:plan`?** Plan takes a feature description and produces tasks. Capture's input is *conversation history* (a fundamentally different shape) and output is a *spec, not tasks*. Forcing both into one skill would conflate distinct phases. Cleaner: capture is a separate phase, output feeds plan.
- **Why source-tag every acceptance criterion?** Practice-scout F1.1 found ~30% of intended requirements get missed by LLM elicitation, and bots fabricate confident answers. Distinguishing `[user]` / `[paraphrase]` / `[inferred]` makes the failure mode visible at read-back. User can reject `[inferred]` items they didn't actually agree to.
- **Why fold grill-me into existing interview skill, not separate skill?** Three small enhancements (~80 lines of skill text total) don't warrant a new top-level command. Folding keeps the user-facing surface stable: `/flow-next:refine` does what it always did, just better.
- Codex sync extended: new `flow-next-capture` openai.yaml entry (`Flow Capture`, brand color `#3B82F6`, default prompt `Capture this as a spec: `); `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` array updated. Canonical skill files use Claude-native `AskUserQuestion`; `sync-codex.sh` rewrites to `request_user_input` for the Codex mirror per repo convention.
- Smoke suites stay green: `audit_smoke_test.sh` (13/41), `smoke_test.sh` (127), `prospect_smoke_test.sh` (94), `ralph_smoke_test.sh` (15). Capture has no flowctl plumbing (zero new subcommands), so no new smoke is required — the skill is exercised manually.

## [flow-next 0.37.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Codex `openai.yaml` UI metadata backfilled for 4 user-facing skills.** Since 0.34.0, every new slash-command skill (`/flow-next:resolve-pr`, `/flow-next:prospect`, `/flow-next:audit`, `/flow-next:memory-migrate`) silently shipped to Codex without UI metadata — raw slug names in the desktop UI, no display name / brand color / default prompt. `scripts/sync-codex.sh` now generates `agents/openai.yaml` for all 13 user-facing skills and uses an explicit `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` array as validation; CI fails when a future skill is added without the matching call.
- **Cross-platform tool-name handling moved into the sync script.** Canonical skill files now use Claude-native tool names (`AskUserQuestion`); `sync-codex.sh` rewrites them to `request_user_input` in the Codex mirror and strips Claude-only `ToolSearch` schema-load fallbacks. Several skills (audit, prospect, memory-migrate, resolve-pr, impl-review walkthrough, prime, setup) had previously documented all platform variants inline (`AskUserQuestion / request_user_input / ask_user`), which polluted the agent's context with abstraction noise. Cleaner: each platform's mirror sees only its native tool name.
- **`flow-next-prime` and `flow-next-setup`** previously had bare `AskUserQuestion` mandates with no Codex / Droid path documented. Now use the canonical pattern (Claude-native tool name, sync-rewritten for Codex mirror) along with the rest of the skills.

### Changed
- **`scripts/sync-codex.sh`** validation block extended: required-skills list (instead of a `>= 9` count threshold) catches missing entries by name; new check that no `AskUserQuestion` or `ToolSearch` references remain in the Codex skill prose post-rewrite.
- **Gemini removed from supported-platform documentation.** flow-next supports Claude Code, Codex, and Factory Droid as first-class targets. Gemini was incidental documentation that crept in.

### Notes
- `CLAUDE.md` `## Cross-platform patterns` section rewritten: explicit architectural rule that canonical files use Claude-native tool names and the sync script handles platform-specific rewrites. New `### Adding a new user-facing skill` checklist documents every step required when shipping a new `/flow-next:<name>` skill (canonical content, slash command, `generate_openai_yaml` call, `REQUIRED_OPENAI_YAML_SKILLS` entry, sync-codex.sh re-run, commands list updates, CHANGELOG, smoke). Captures the lessons from the 0.34.0 → 0.37.0 silent-degradation era.
- Droid mirror infrastructure (similar to Codex) is a future hotfix; for now Droid users see canonical Claude-native names.

## [flow-next 0.37.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`/flow-next:audit [mode:autofix] [scope hint]` — agent-native memory staleness review.** New skill that walks `.flow/memory/`, reviews each entry against the current codebase using the host agent's own Read/Grep/Glob tools, and decides per entry whether to **Keep / Update / Consolidate / Replace / Delete**. Adapted to the categorized memory schema shipped in 0.33.0. The audit IS the agent: no Python audit engine, no codex/copilot subprocess dispatch, no deterministic scorer. The host agent reads the workflow markdown and executes it directly. Subagent dispatch documented for Claude Code (`Agent` + Explore), Codex (`spawn_agent` + explorer), and Droid; orchestrator falls back to main-thread investigation when subagent primitives are unavailable.
- **Two modes:** **Interactive** (default) — agent asks decisions per entry via the platform's blocking-question tool (`AskUserQuestion` / `request_user_input` / `ask_user`). **Autofix** (`mode:autofix` token) — applies unambiguous Keep/Update/Consolidate/Replace/Delete actions and marks ambiguous entries as stale via `flowctl memory mark-stale`; this is the Ralph-safe path. Scope hint follows the mode token (`/flow-next:audit mode:autofix runtime-errors`).
- **`flowctl memory mark-stale <id> --reason "..." [--audited-by "..."] [--json]`** — sets `status: stale`, stamps `last_audited` (UTC date), records `audit_notes` from `--reason`. Atomic via existing `write_memory_entry`; body untouched. Idempotent: re-mark replaces `audit_notes` and re-stamps `last_audited`. Used by `/flow-next:audit`, also callable directly. JSON shape: `{success, id, path, status, last_audited, audit_notes}`.
- **`flowctl memory mark-fresh <id> [--audited-by "..."] [--json]`** — clears stale flag (drops `status`, `audit_notes`), stamps `last_audited`. Idempotent on already-active entries.
- **`flowctl memory search --status active|stale|all`** — mirrors `memory list`'s `--status` flag (default `active`). Stale entries are excluded from default search results so audit-flagged advice stops polluting `memory-scout` output. Existing `memory list --status` behavior unchanged.
- **Schema extension:** `MEMORY_OPTIONAL_FIELDS` extended with `last_audited` and `audit_notes`. `MEMORY_FIELD_ORDER` updated; `_MEMORY_QUOTED_STRING_FIELDS` includes `last_audited` (date string survives PyYAML date coercion). Validator picks up additions automatically via the allowed-fields union.
- **`/flow-next:memory-migrate [mode:autofix] [scope hint]` — agent-native legacy migration.** Same architectural fix applied to legacy migration as `/flow-next:audit` applied to staleness review. The host agent reads each legacy entry from `.flow/memory/{pitfalls,conventions,decisions}.md`, classifies it into the right `(track, category)` pair using its own intelligence + repo context, and writes a categorized entry via `flowctl memory add`. Interactive (asks via the platform's blocking-question tool on ambiguous entries) or autofix (accepts mechanical default + logs as `needs-review` in the report). Inline skill (no `context: fork`) so question tools stay reachable across phases. Optional scope hint after the mode token narrows the run to a single legacy file (e.g. `pitfalls.md`). Phase 4 cleanup writes a self-ignoring `.flow/memory/_migrated/.gitignore` (`*`) and renames originals on user consent (autofix declines by default; never auto-deletes).
- **`flowctl memory list-legacy [--json]`** — emits parsed legacy entries with mechanical default `(track, category)` per entry. Used by `/flow-next:memory-migrate` skill; also useful for ad-hoc inspection. JSON shape: `{files: [{filename, entry_count, entries: [{title, body, tags, date, mechanical_track, mechanical_category}]}]}`. Returns `{files: []}` (rc=0) when no legacy files exist.

### Changed
- README + website lifecycle text now mentions `/flow-next:audit` and `/flow-next:memory-migrate` alongside the categorized memory schema. CLAUDE.md memory-system block adds audit + mark-stale + mark-fresh + search-status + memory-migrate bullets.
- `smoke_test.sh` memory section: `memory search 'stale example'` now passes `--status all` (default-active is the new contract); a complementary assertion verifies the default-active behavior. New `memory list-legacy` smoke (4 cases: empty dir, two-entry parse, mechanical defaults present, text mode) appended after the migrate block.
- **`flowctl memory migrate` is now deterministic-only.** The codex/copilot subprocess classification chain has been removed (~225 LoC across six functions: `_memory_classify_run_codex`, `_memory_classify_run_copilot`, `_memory_classify_select_backend`, `_memory_classify_build_prompt`, `_memory_classify_parse_response`, `_memory_classify_entry`). Mechanical filename → `(track, category)` heuristic (`_memory_classify_mechanical`) is the only path. For accurate per-entry classification, use the new `/flow-next:memory-migrate` skill — host agent classifies in-context. JSON receipt shape preserved (`method` always `"mechanical"`, `model` always `null`) for backcompat with pre-fn-35 callers. `--no-llm` flag accepted-but-noop (avoids breaking scripted callers).
- `flowctl memory migrate` now emits a one-time stderr deprecation hint (TTY only; suppressible via `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1`) pointing at `/flow-next:memory-migrate` for accurate classification. Stderr-only — `--json` pipelines stay clean.

### Removed
- **`FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_BACKEND`, `FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`, `FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_EFFORT` env vars** are no longer consumed (subprocess classifier dispatch was removed). Setting them now triggers a one-time stderr warning so users with leftover env vars notice they're now dead. Suppressible via `FLOW_NO_DEPRECATION=1`.

### Notes
- **Legacy entries skipped.** Pre-fn-30 flat files (`pitfalls.md`, `conventions.md`, `decisions.md`) have no per-entry frontmatter to mutate, so `/flow-next:audit` skips them with a warning recommending `/flow-next:memory-migrate` first. The skipped count surfaces in the audit report.
- **No silent deletes.** The `Delete` outcome is reserved for unambiguous cases (code gone AND problem domain gone). Ambiguous cases default to mark-stale; the entry stays on disk and shows up under `--status stale` until a future audit confirms removal.
- **Why agent-native, not flowctl Python?** flow-next runs inside an agentic environment (Claude Code / Codex / Droid). The host agent already reads files, runs grep, judges relevance, and writes updates with its own tools. Spawning a second LLM via subprocess is wasteful (cost + latency) and adds machinery — subprocess timeouts, structured-verdict parsers, drift guards — that disappears in the agent-native architecture. **fn-34 (audit) and fn-35 (memory-migrate) ship together as 0.37.0 — the same architectural correction applied to two parallel features.** Future Ralph hooks / receipts / triage-skip stay subprocess-based per the agentic-vs-deterministic guidance in CLAUDE.md (those run from non-agent contexts).
- **Why thin flowctl plumbing instead of skill-only?** The skills need deterministic atomic frontmatter writes (`mark-stale` / `mark-fresh` for audit; `memory add` + `memory list-legacy` for migrate), schema-validated round-trip, and consistent search filtering. Those are pure persistence concerns where flowctl shines. Split rule: flowctl owns "set this field on this entry" / "parse these legacy segments"; skill owns "should this entry be flagged" / "which (track, category) does this belong in."
- Smoke suite: dedicated `plugins/flow-next/scripts/audit_smoke_test.sh` (13 cases, 41 assertions, ~5s runtime, zero LLM calls — covers Task 2 plumbing only since skills aren't unit-testable). `smoke_test.sh` (127, +1 for `list-legacy`), `prospect_smoke_test.sh` (94), `ralph_smoke_test.sh` (15) all stay green. Unit tests: 341 passing.

## [flow-next 0.36.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`/flow-next:prospect [focus hint]` — upstream-of-plan idea generation.** New user-triggered command that fills the "what should I build?" gap above `/flow-next:refine` and `/flow-next:plan`. Generates many candidate ideas grounded in the repo, critiques every one with explicit rejection reasons, and surfaces only the survivors bucketed by leverage. Output is a ranked artifact under `.flow/prospects/<slug>-<date>.md` that feeds directly into `interview` or `plan` via `flowctl prospect promote`. Lifecycle is now `prospect → interview → plan → work` for unformed targets; existing users with clear targets skip `prospect` and go straight to `interview` / `plan`.
- **Phase order:** Phase 0 resume check (artifacts <30 days old) → Phase 1 grounding (recent files, open epics, memory, audit, CHANGELOG) → Phase 2 persona-seeded divergent generate (`senior-maintainer` / `first-time-user` / `adversarial-reviewer`, ≥2 personas) → Phase 3 second-pass critique (separate prompt; rejection taxonomy: `duplicates-open-epic | out-of-scope | insufficient-signal | too-large | backward-incompat | other`) → Phase 4 bucketed rank (`High leverage 1-3` / `Worth considering 4-7` / `If you have the time 8+`; prose-only, no numeric scores) → Phase 5 atomic artifact write → Phase 6 frozen-format handoff prompt (`1`|`2`|`...`|`skip`|`interview`).
- **Volume semantics:** `top N` = exactly N survivors; `N ideas` = generate ≥N candidates; `raise the bar` = 60-70% rejection target; default = 15-25 candidates → 5-8 survivors.
- **Rejection floor (R12):** critique must reject ≥40% (or 60-70% under `raise the bar`); on floor violation the skill asks whether to regenerate, loosen, or ship anyway — no silent pass-through.
- **`flowctl prospect list / read / archive / promote` subcommands.** `list` defaults to <30-day artifacts (`--all` shows everything including archived and stale; columns: id, date, focus, survivor count, promoted count, status). `read` accepts full id, slug+date, slug-only (latest wins) and supports `--section focus|grounding|survivors|rejected`. `archive` moves to `.flow/prospects/_archive/`. `promote <id> --idea <N> [--epic-title "..."] [--force] [--json]` reads survivor #N's title/summary/leverage, allocates an epic via the same scan-based logic as `cmd_epic_create`, and writes the spec skeleton in one shot (mirrors `cmd_epic_create` allocation, but inlines the spec write so the prospect-context spec is on disk from the first byte). Success output: `Promoted idea #N ("<title>") to <epic-id>. Next: /flow-next:refine <epic-id>`.
- **Idempotency guard (R14, R20):** promote refuses if the artifact's `promoted_to` frontmatter already contains the target idea; `--force` overrides. Successful promote atomically appends to the artifact's `promoted_to` map (inline-flow YAML dict `{N: [epic-A, epic-B]}` with bare-numeric keys), so subsequent `list` shows `<promoted>/<survivors>` counts.
- **Ralph-out (R8):** `/flow-next:prospect` is exploratory and human-in-the-loop. Hard-errors with exit 2 when `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` or `FLOW_RALPH=1` is set (matches fn-32 `--interactive` treatment). No env-var opt-in.
- **Atomic artifact writes (R4):** `.flow/prospects/<slug>-<date>.md` written via write-then-rename before the Phase 6 handoff prompt — Ctrl-C at handoff preserves the artifact. Same-day slug collision suffixes with `-2`, `-3` (R13). YAML frontmatter shape: `title`, `date` (quoted-string round-trip), `focus_hint`, `volume`, `survivor_count`, `rejected_count`, `rejection_rate`, `artifact_id`, `promoted_to` (omitted when empty), `status` (`active` | `corrupt` | `stale` | `archived`); optional `floor_violation` and `generation_under_volume` flags omitted when unset.
- **Malformed-artifact detection (R16):** resume check validates frontmatter parses and required sections exist; corrupt artifacts surface in `list --all` with `corrupt (<reason>)` in the status column and are never offered for extension. `flowctl prospect read` on a corrupt artifact exits **3** (distinct from Ralph-block exit 2). `flowctl prospect promote` on a corrupt artifact also exits **3** (stderr marker `[ARTIFACT CORRUPT: <reason>]`); `promote` on a duplicate idea without `--force` exits **2** with a message referencing the prior epic-id.
- **Graceful degradation (R17):** grounding records `scanned: none (reason)` when git/CHANGELOG/memory/audit is absent — no fatal errors on minimal repos.
- **flowctl helper surface (Phase 5/6 + write/list/read/archive/promote):**
  - Phase 3 (artifact writer): `write_prospect_artifact`, `render_prospect_body`, `validate_prospect_frontmatter`, `_prospect_slug`, `_prospect_next_id`, `PROSPECT_REQUIRED_FIELDS` / `PROSPECT_OPTIONAL_FIELDS` / `PROSPECT_FIELD_ORDER`.
  - Phase 4 (CLI + parsing): `_prospect_parse_frontmatter`, `_prospect_detect_corruption`, `_prospect_artifact_status`, `_prospect_resolve_id`, `_prospect_iter_artifacts`, `_prospect_extract_section`, `_prospect_extract_survivors`, `_prospect_extract_rejected`, `get_prospects_dir`, plus the `PROSPECT_CORRUPT_*` module constants that own the R16 reason-string contract.
  - Phase 5 (promote): `_render_epic_skeleton_from_prospect`, `_prospect_rewrite_in_place` (shared atomic in-place rewrite, used by both `cmd_prospect_archive` and `cmd_prospect_promote`), and the inline-flow dict branch added to `_format_prospect_yaml_value` for the `promoted_to` field. Survivor lookup is inlined via `next((s for s in _prospect_extract_survivors(body) if s["position"] == N), None)` — no standalone `_extract_survivor` helper. Promote inlines epic allocation + spec write rather than calling `cmd_epic_create` + `cmd_epic_set_plan`, so the prospect-context spec lands on disk from the first byte.

### Changed
- README/website lifecycle diagrams updated: prospect → interview → plan → work for the unformed-target path; existing flows (Spec → Interview/Plan → Work, Plan → Work, etc.) unchanged. Prospect is purely additive — no existing surface modified.

### Notes
- **User-triggered only.** Ralph autonomous loop is unaffected — no automatic invocation, no receipt writes, no shared state. Autonomous loops have no business deciding what a repo should tackle next.
- **Inline skill (no `context: fork`)** keeps `AskUserQuestion` available throughout. Subagents can't call blocking question tools (Claude Code issues #12890, #34592), and Phases 0 + 6 both require user choice.
- **Numbered-options fallback (R19)** frozen string format `1`|`2`|`...`|`skip`|`interview`; tested under cross-backend smoke for backends without a blocking question tool.
- **Persona seeding (R18):** post-RLHF LLMs exhibit pronounced mode collapse. Persona-seeded divergent generation converges on distinct semantic regions, measurably increasing idea diversity. ≥2 personas; spec names three to choose from.
- **Why bucketed ranking (3/4/∞) instead of flat?** Prose-only ranking is robust for top-3 but near-random past position 5 across reruns. Bucketing stabilizes the top-3 while preserving prose reasoning within each bucket.
- **Why two-pass generate-then-critique?** Single-pass prompts soft-reject — everything is kept, just ordered. Two passes with separate system prompts force explicit rejection with a taxonomy; the critique pass doesn't see its own generation prompt, avoiding rationalization.
- Smoke suite: dedicated `plugins/flow-next/scripts/prospect_smoke_test.sh` (11 cases, 94 assertions, ~58s runtime, zero LLM calls — pattern matches `impl-review_smoke_test.sh` from fn-32). Existing `smoke_test.sh` unchanged (regression-checked only). Unit tests: 308 passing.

## [flow-next 0.35.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **`/flow-next:resolve-pr` now parallel-dispatches on Codex.** Codex 0.102.0+ ships native multi-agent role support and `pr-comment-resolver.toml` installs into `~/.codex/agents/` via `scripts/install-codex.sh` — the skill and workflow now instruct parallel spawn on Codex using the same file-overlap wave pattern used on Claude Code. Copilot and Droid stay serial (no native parallel dispatch). Previous docs were stale — the machinery was already in place via fn-24 but the resolve-pr skill defaulted Codex to serial.

## [flow-next 0.35.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`--validate` flag on `/flow-next:impl-review`.** After a `NEEDS_WORK` verdict, dispatches a validator pass (same backend session, receipt-driven session resume) that independently re-checks each finding against the current code and drops false-positives with logged reasons. If all findings drop, the verdict upgrades `NEEDS_WORK → SHIP` (never downgrades from `SHIP` or `MAJOR_RETHINK`); `verdict_before_validate` is recorded on upgrade. Receipt carries `validator: {dispatched, dropped, kept, reasons}` plus `validator_timestamp`. Env opt-in: `FLOW_VALIDATE_REVIEW=1` (works in Ralph). Conservative bias — "only drop if clearly wrong; when uncertain, keep" (findings missing from validator output default to kept). New `flowctl codex validate` / `flowctl copilot validate` subcommands invoke the pass in the same chat session.
- **`--deep` flag on `/flow-next:impl-review`.** Layers specialized deep-dive passes on top of the primary Carmack-level review in the same backend session: adversarial (always), security + performance (auto-enabled based on changed-file globs via `flowctl review-deep-auto`). Findings tagged `pass: <name>`; merged with primary via fingerprint dedup (primary wins on collision); primary+deep cross-pass agreement promotes the primary finding's confidence one anchor step (0→25→50→75→100, ceiling 100). Cross-deep collisions dedup without promotion (avoids double-counting correlated passes). Explicit pass selection: `--deep=adversarial,security`. Env opt-in: `FLOW_REVIEW_DEEP=1` (works in Ralph). Receipt carries `deep_passes` array, `deep_findings_count` per-pass dict, `cross_pass_promotions` list of `{id, from, to, pass}`, and `deep_timestamp`. Deep may upgrade verdict `SHIP → NEEDS_WORK` when it surfaces new blocking `introduced` findings (records `verdict_before_deep`); deep never downgrades. New `flowctl codex deep-pass` / `flowctl copilot deep-pass` subcommands; new `flowctl review-deep-auto` helper reads changed files from stdin and emits the auto-enabled pass list.
- **`--interactive` flag on `/flow-next:impl-review`.** Per-finding walkthrough via the platform's blocking question tool (AskUserQuestion / request_user_input / ask_user). Four actions per finding: Apply / Defer / Skip / Acknowledge. "LFG the rest" escape hatch auto-classifies the remainder: `P0/P1` at confidence ≥ 75 → Apply; otherwise → Defer (mirrors the primary-review suppression gate). Deferred findings append to `.flow/review-deferred/<branch-slug>.md` (append-only; each review session gets a new `## <timestamp> — review session <receipt-id>` section; branch slug allows `a-zA-Z0-9-_.`). **Ralph-incompatible by design** — hard-errors when `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` or `FLOW_RALPH=1` is set. Receipt carries `walkthrough: {applied, deferred, skipped, acknowledged, lfg_rest}` + `walkthrough_timestamp`. Walkthrough never flips the verdict. New helpers: `flowctl review-walkthrough-defer` (appends to the sink atomically) and `flowctl review-walkthrough-record` (stamps walkthrough counts + timestamp into the receipt).

### Changed
- Review workflow documents the phase ordering for flag combinations: **primary → deep → validate → interactive → verdict**.
- Receipt schema gains optional fields: `validator`, `validator_timestamp`, `verdict_before_validate` (validate); `deep_passes`, `deep_findings_count`, `cross_pass_promotions`, `verdict_before_deep`, `deep_timestamp` (deep); `walkthrough` (with `lfg_rest`), `walkthrough_timestamp` (interactive). All additive — existing Ralph scripts read by key and ignore unknowns.
- **Copilot backend model catalog + defaults refreshed.** Added `claude-opus-4.7`, `claude-opus-4.6`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex` to the registered model set (verified live against copilot CLI 1.0.36 via `copilot -p "/model"`). Default bumped `gpt-5.2` → `gpt-5.5`; `high` effort retained (confirmed `gpt-5.5` honors `--effort {low,medium,high,xhigh}`). Older rows stay listed — copilot itself still accepts them. Use `flowctl config set review.backend copilot:<model>:<effort>` to pin a different model.

### Notes
- **Default review is unchanged.** These flags are opt-in. The Carmack-level single-chat primary review remains the baseline and the primary. Flags add structure, validation, and deep-dives **on top** — they do not replace.
- `--deep` in same backend session means context carry-over (cheaper per pass); parallel multi-agent dispatch intentionally not adopted to preserve rp/codex/copilot parity.
- `--interactive` has no env var; per-invocation only to prevent accidental Ralph engagement.
- Depends on flow-next 0.32.1+ (confidence anchors, pre-existing classification) for flag semantics.
- Smoke suite: 217 unit tests pass; `impl-review_smoke_test.sh` covers the 7-case flag-combination matrix (74 assertions, ~58s wall-clock including 4-config parallel Ralph sweep).

## [flow-next 0.34.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`/flow-next:resolve-pr` — PR feedback resolver.** New user-triggered command for resolving GitHub PR review threads. Fetches unresolved threads, triages new vs pending-decision, dispatches parallel (Claude Code) or serial (Codex/Copilot/Droid) resolver agents, validates combined state, commits + pushes fixes, replies and resolves via GraphQL.
- **Handles all three feedback surfaces:** inline review threads, top-level PR comments, and review submission bodies. GraphQL resolves threads; PR-comment replies via `gh pr comment`.
- **Cross-invocation cluster analysis.** When multiple review rounds reveal recurring patterns in the same file/subtree, dispatches a cluster-aware resolver that investigates the broader area before making targeted fixes. Gated on both: prior-resolved threads exist AND spatial-overlap with new threads.
- **Targeted mode:** pass a comment URL to resolve a single thread only.
- **`--dry-run` flag:** fetch + plan, no edits/commits/replies.
- **`--no-cluster` flag:** skip cluster analysis, all items individual.
- **`pr-comment-resolver` agent:** single-thread resolver subagent with read-only investigation (git/gh) + Edit/Write for fixes; never commits/pushes (orchestrator owns that).
- **GraphQL scripts bundled:** `get-pr-comments`, `get-thread-for-comment`, `reply-to-pr-thread`, `resolve-pr-thread`. Zero runtime deps beyond `gh` + `jq`.

### Notes
- User-triggered only. Ralph autonomous loop is unaffected — no automatic invocation, no receipt writes, no shared state.
- Safety: comment text is untrusted input; resolvers never execute shell commands from comment bodies.
- Verify loop bounded at 2 fix-verify cycles; 3rd attempt escalates pattern to user.
- Smoke test: `plugins/flow-next/scripts/resolve-pr_smoke_test.sh`.

## [flow-next 0.33.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Categorized memory schema.** `.flow/memory/` is now a tree under `bug/` (build-errors, test-failures, runtime-errors, performance, security, integration, data, ui) and `knowledge/` (architecture-patterns, conventions, tooling-decisions, workflow, best-practices). Each entry is a single file with YAML frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `track`, `category`, `module`, `tags`, plus track-specific fields: `problem_type` / `root_cause` / `resolution_type` for bug; `applies_when` for knowledge). Entry IDs are `<track>/<category>/<slug>-<date>` matching filepath.
- **Overlap detection on `memory add`.** Scans existing entries in the target category. High overlap updates the existing entry in place; moderate overlap creates a new entry with `related_to: [existing-id]` in its frontmatter. Prevents silent duplication drift.
- **`flowctl memory migrate`.** Converts legacy `.flow/memory/pitfalls.md` / `conventions.md` / `decisions.md` into categorized entries via fast-model classification. `--dry-run` prints plan; `--yes` applies; `--no-llm` uses mechanical defaults. Classifier auto-selects `codex` (default `gpt-5.4-mini`) or `copilot` (default `claude-haiku-4.5`); override via `FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_BACKEND=codex|copilot|none`, `FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`, `FLOW_MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_EFFORT`. Idempotent (re-run reports "No legacy files to migrate."). JSON mode refuses writes without `--yes` as a safety guard. Per-entry JSON shape: `{source, source_entry, target, target_path, method, model}`; top-level adds `moved_legacy`, `count`, `dry_run`, `legacy_moved_to`.
- **`flowctl memory discoverability-patch`.** Optional command that adds a `.flow/memory/` reference to the project's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md so agents without flow-next loaded can discover the store. Two strategies: `listing` (injects into an existing `.flow/` fenced code block) and `append` (adds a `## Memory / Learnings` section). Auto-target detection prefers AGENTS.md when both are substantive; handles `@AGENTS.md` / `@CLAUDE.md` shims and symlinks. JSON shape: `{target, action, reason, notes, strategy, diff, message}` where `action ∈ {exists, applied, dry-run, skipped}`. `--apply` and `--dry-run` are mutually exclusive (exit 2). JSON callers must pass `--apply` explicitly — the command refuses destructive auto-writes.
- **Ralph auto-capture rewrite.** Worker agent writes structured bug-track entries via `memory add --track bug --category <c>` on NEEDS_WORK → SHIP. Overlap detection handles duplicates automatically.
- **Category-aware memory-scout.** Scout returns track/category-tagged results, prioritizing module-matched entries.

### Changed
- `memory list` / `read` / `search` gain `--track` and `--category` filter flags; still read legacy flat files until migration runs.
- `memory list` also gains `--status active|stale|all` (default: `active`) — stale entries hidden unless asked.
- `memory search` also gains `--module <m>`, `--tags "a,b"`, `--limit <N>` filters plus weighted token-overlap scoring (title 5×, tags 3×, body 1.5×, misc 1×).
- `memory read` accepts three id forms — full (`bug/runtime-errors/slug-YYYY-MM-DD`), slug+date (unique lookup), and slug-only (latest date wins) — plus legacy forms (`legacy/pitfalls.md`, `legacy/pitfalls#N`).
- Legacy hits in `search` surface as synthetic entries with `track: "legacy"` and `entry_id` like `legacy/pitfalls#3` (1-based).
- JSON output shapes: `list` returns `{entries, legacy, count, status}`; `search` returns `{query, matches, count}`; `read` returns `{entry_id, path, frontmatter, body}` (categorized) or `{entry_id, path, legacy: true, body, index?}` (legacy).

### Deprecated
- `memory add --type pitfall|convention|decision` maps to new `--track/--category` flags with a deprecation warning. Will be removed in 0.36.0.

### Notes
- Backward compatible: legacy `.flow/memory/*.md` flat files continue to work until `memory migrate` runs; `list` / `read` / `search` read both.
- Opt-in remains the default — `flowctl init` does not create memory; run `flowctl config set memory.enabled true` and `flowctl memory init` to opt in.
- Smoke suite: 99 tests pass (adds memory migrate + discoverability-patch coverage).

## [flow-next 0.32.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Requirement-ID traceability (R-IDs).** Epic specs emit numbered acceptance criteria (`- **R1:**`, `- **R2:**`, ...). Task specs support optional `satisfies: [R1, R3]` frontmatter. Impl-review and epic-review produce per-R-ID coverage tables (met / partial / not-addressed / deferred). Any unaddressed R-ID flips verdict to `NEEDS_WORK`; receipt carries an `unaddressed` array. Renumber-forbidden after first review cycle — deletions leave gaps, new criteria take the next unused number. Plan skill writes R-IDs on creation; plan-sync preserves them during drift updates.
- **Confidence anchors (0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100) + suppression gate.** Reviewers score each finding on exactly five discrete anchors. Findings below 75 are suppressed except P0 @ 50+. Reviews report `suppressed_count` by anchor; receipt optionally carries a `suppressed_count` dict. Prose rubric tells the reviewer to treat scores as integers, not a continuous scale.
- **Introduced vs pre-existing classification.** Reviewers mark each finding `introduced: true` (caused by this branch's diff) or `pre_existing: true` (broken on the base branch). Verdict gate considers only `introduced`. Pre-existing findings surface in a separate non-blocking "Pre-existing issues" section. Receipt carries `introduced_count` and `pre_existing_count`.
- **Protected artifacts list in review prompts.** Hardcoded never-flag paths (`.flow/*`, `.flow/bin/*`, `.flow/memory/*`, `docs/plans/*`, `docs/solutions/*`, `scripts/ralph/*`). Review synthesis discards findings recommending their deletion or gitignore. Prevents cross-model reviewers unfamiliar with flow-next conventions from proposing destructive cleanups.
- **Trivial-diff skip (`flowctl triage-skip`).** Deterministic whitelist pre-check (lockfile-only / docs-only / release-chore / generated-file-only) returns `VERDICT=SHIP` with receipt `mode: triage_skip` and `source: deterministic`. Optional fast-model LLM judge (`gpt-5-mini` / `claude-haiku-4.5`) gated behind `FLOW_TRIAGE_LLM=1`; deterministic layer is conservative (ambiguous → REVIEW). On by default in Ralph mode; opt-out via `--no-triage` or `FLOW_RALPH_NO_TRIAGE=1`. Saves rp / codex / copilot calls on trivial commits.

### Changed
- Impl-review and epic-review workflows now emit structured per-finding metadata (severity, confidence, introduced/pre_existing) instead of free-form prose.
- Receipt schema gains optional fields: `unaddressed`, `suppressed_count`, `introduced_count`, `pre_existing_count`, plus new receipt `mode: triage_skip`. All additive — existing Ralph scripts read by key and ignore unknowns.

### Notes
- Zero breaking changes. Specs without R-IDs continue to work. Ralph's autonomous loop is unchanged in shape; review inputs and outputs are sharper.
- Carmack-level review remains the default and baseline. This release adds structure; it does not change the review style.
- Smoke suite: 71 tests pass (unchanged — rollup is prompt + docs only).

## [flow-next 0.32.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Codex default model: `gpt-5.5 + high`.** GPT-5.5 is now the codex backend default for cross-model reviews. Live-probed: codex CLI 0.124.0 accepts `--model gpt-5.5` with `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'` (verdict=SHIP returned cleanly). Added to `BACKEND_REGISTRY["codex"]["models"]`; previous `gpt-5.4` still valid for anyone who wants to pin explicitly via `--review=codex:gpt-5.4:high` or `FLOW_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4`. Registry default flipped from `gpt-5.4` → `gpt-5.5`. All docs (README catalog table, skill `(default ...)` prose, workflow spec-form examples) updated to match.

### Changed
- **Codex-only: `@browser` → `@agent-browser`** to avoid collision with OpenAI's bundled **Browser Use** plugin (Codex desktop v0.124+). The two tools have non-overlapping scope:
  - **Browser Use** (OpenAI bundled, Codex desktop only) — in-app browser widget for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `file://`, or the current in-app tab. No cookies, no auth, no extensions, no production sites, no Electron apps.
  - **`@agent-browser`** (this skill, Codex + CLI + all hosts) — full Chrome-via-CDP browser. Cookies, saved sessions, production sites, authenticated flows, Electron desktop apps (VS Code / Slack / Figma / etc), iOS Simulator, proxies, video recording, visual diff.

  Claude Code and Factory Droid continue to expose the skill as `@browser` (no OpenAI collision there, no muscle-memory break). The rename is Codex-mirror-only — performed by `scripts/sync-codex.sh` during regeneration.
- Codex version of the skill now carries a **prose-based delegation preface** explaining when to hand off to Browser Use vs use this skill. Written for the model, not the user — prose invocation ("Use the Browser Use plugin to open http://localhost:3000") rather than `@`-autocomplete (LLMs can't interactively pick from menus). Explicit CLI fallback: Browser Use doesn't exist in Codex CLI, so always use this skill there.

### Notes
- 112 unit tests pass (6 updated to expect `gpt-5.5` as the codex default).
- 67 smoke tests pass.
- No changes to Claude Code / Droid skill source — only the Codex mirror is renamed.

## [flow-next 0.31.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Unified review backend spec parser** — `backend[:model[:effort]]` grammar accepted at every surface (env, config, per-task, per-epic, CLI flag). `parse_backend_spec()` + `BackendSpec` dataclass + `BACKEND_REGISTRY` (rp/codex/copilot/none) validate specs on store; invalid values rejected with helpful errors listing valid models/efforts. Legacy bare-backend values (`codex`, `copilot`, `rp`) still work unchanged. Unparseable strings on disk degrade to bare backend with a stderr warning — never crash.
- Backend registry (static dict in `flowctl.py`):
  - `codex`: models `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-codex`; efforts `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`; defaults `gpt-5.4` / `high`.
  - `copilot`: models `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `claude-haiku-4.5`, `claude-opus-4.5`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-4.1`; efforts `low|medium|high|xhigh`; defaults `gpt-5.2` / `high`. `claude-*` models drop `--effort` at runtime.
  - `rp` and `none`: bare-only (no model/effort).
- **Resolution precedence** (first match wins): `--spec` CLI flag > per-task `review` > per-epic `default_review` > `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` env > `.flow/config.json` `review.backend` > backend-specific env (`FLOW_CODEX_MODEL` / `FLOW_CODEX_EFFORT` / `FLOW_COPILOT_MODEL` / `FLOW_COPILOT_EFFORT`) > registry default. Env fills **missing** fields only — explicit spec values always win.
- `--spec backend:model:effort` flag on all six review commands: `flowctl {codex,copilot} {impl,plan,completion}-review`. Parses + resolves + threads `model` + `effort` into `run_codex_exec` / `run_copilot_exec`.
- `flowctl review-backend --json` now returns `{backend, spec, model, effort, source}` — full resolved spec + field-level source tag (`env` / `config` / `none`). Text mode still prints bare backend for skill grep back-compat.
- `flowctl task show-backend --json` / `flowctl epic show-backend --json` expose raw stored spec + resolved spec + per-field source (`task` / `epic` / `env` / `default`).
- `parse_backend_spec_lenient()` + `resolve_review_spec()` helpers centralise spec parsing for skills and Ralph.
- Ralph integration: `scripts/ralph/config.env` accepts spec form on `PLAN_REVIEW` / `WORK_REVIEW` / `COMPLETION_REVIEW` (e.g. `WORK_REVIEW=codex:gpt-5.4:xhigh`). `ralph.sh` exports the full spec via `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` and derives `PLAN_REVIEW_BACKEND` / `WORK_REVIEW_BACKEND` / `COMPLETION_REVIEW_BACKEND` (bare backend, via `${VAR%%:*}`) so existing prompt-level branching keeps working unchanged.
- Review skills (`flow-next-impl-review`, `flow-next-plan-review`, `flow-next-epic-review`) document the `--spec` flag + spec grammar + precedence in both SKILL.md and workflow.md. `flow-next-setup` workflow now offers spec-form defaults.
- Receipts include a new `spec` field alongside `model` + `effort`: `{"mode": "codex", "model": "gpt-5.4", "effort": "high", "spec": "codex:gpt-5.4:high"}`. `spec` is the canonical round-trippable form (via `str(resolved_spec)`); older readers that only look at `model` + `effort` stay correct.
- Smoke suite: 60 → 67 tests (backend spec validation, set-backend rejection paths, show-backend field sources, legacy fallback). Unit tests: 56 → 112 (parser edges, registry integrity, precedence resolution, Ralph bare-backend extraction, `cmd_review_backend` JSON shape).

### Changed
- Aspirational `--review=codex:gpt-5.4-high` help text (never implemented) replaced with real `backend:model:effort` grammar. No migration needed; old stored bare-backend values continue to parse.
- `run_codex_exec` and `run_copilot_exec` now take a resolved `BackendSpec` argument instead of ad-hoc `model=` / `effort=` kwargs. Env-var fallback moved up into `BackendSpec.resolve()`.

## [flow-next 0.30.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot CLI review backend** — third cross-platform option alongside RepoPrompt and Codex. New `flowctl copilot` command group (`check`, `impl-review`, `plan-review`, `completion-review`) with same receipt schema as Codex. Session continuity via client-generated UUIDs (`copilot --resume=<uuid>` creates-or-resumes; flowctl stores the UUID, reuses it on re-review). Text mode output with `<verdict>` tag extraction. Temp-file prompt delivery handles >100KB prompts and dodges Windows `ARG_MAX`.
- `flowctl copilot check` does a live auth probe (trivial `-p "ok"` with `gpt-5-mini` + `effort=low`) instead of only checking binary presence — auth failures surface here, not at first review. GPT model chosen because Claude-family models reject `--effort`.
- Review skills (`flow-next-impl-review`, `flow-next-plan-review`, `flow-next-epic-review`) branch on `copilot` backend.
- `/flow-next:setup` auto-detects `copilot` on `PATH` and offers it as a review backend option.
- Ralph integration: `ralph-guard.py` bumped to `0.14.0` — blocks direct `copilot` calls outside `flowctl copilot …` wrappers and blocks `--continue` (conflicts with parallel sessions / multiple projects). New `copilot_review_succeeded` state key. `ralph-init` templates (`config.env`, `ralph.sh`, `prompt_{plan,work,completion}.md`) carry the `copilot` review branch.
- Runtime knobs (env-only, no CLI flags): `FLOW_COPILOT_MODEL` (default `gpt-5.2`; matches Codex's GPT-5.x + high philosophy), `FLOW_COPILOT_EFFORT` (default `high`; `low|medium|high|xhigh`), `FLOW_COPILOT_EMBED_MAX_BYTES` (default `512000`). Resolved via `env > arg > default` cascade in `_resolve_copilot_model_effort()` and stamped into every receipt (`model` + `effort` keys) for reproducibility. `ralph.sh` conditionally exports each var only when set, so empty values in `config.env` fall back to flowctl defaults instead of clobbering them. Claude-family models reject `--effort`; flowctl omits the flag automatically for them.
- Model catalog: `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `claude-haiku-4.5`, `claude-opus-4.5`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-4.1`.
- Smoke suite grew 52 → 59 tests (4 copilot command-help checks + 3 live copilot e2e: `plan-review`, `plan-review` re-resume asserting stable `session_id`, `impl-review`). Live e2e uses `gpt-5-mini` + `FLOW_COPILOT_EFFORT=low` to minimise premium-request cost.
- README `Cross-Model Reviews` section documents Copilot on equal footing with RP and Codex (setup, usage, verify, env vars, which-to-choose table). `CLAUDE.md` project guide lists Copilot as a valid review backend. All `--review=` flag tables now enumerate `rp|codex|copilot|export|none`.

### Changed
- RepoPrompt remains the recommended (best-context) backend. Codex and Copilot are both listed as cross-platform alternatives for Linux / Windows / CI / headless.
- Inline `backend:model:effort` spec parsing is intentionally out of scope here — that unification ships in a follow-up epic so RP, Codex and Copilot can all be retrofitted in one pass.

## [flow-next 0.29.4] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **rp-cli 2.1.6: builder output missing tab/context ID** — `cmd_rp_builder` and `cmd_rp_setup_review` now always pass `--raw-json` to builder (was conditional on `--response-type`). RP 2.1.6 removed the `Tab:`/`Context:` text line from plain-text output; IDs are only in JSON mode. JSON parse tried first, regex fallback for older RP versions. Closes #109. Thanks @berhanbero
- **Python 3.12+ `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation** — replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in `now_iso()` and `cmd_memory_add`. Eliminates `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.12+.

### Changed
- README recommends RepoPrompt v2.1.6+ and documents update path (`brew upgrade --cask repoprompt`)

## [flow-next 0.29.3] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **RepoPrompt 2.x `oracle_send` support** — `flowctl rp chat-send` now prefers RP 2.x `oracle_send` over legacy `chat_send`, falling back only on missing-tool errors. Strips `chat_name` and `selected_paths` fields that RP 2.1.x rejects. Real errors propagate immediately instead of being masked by fallback. Thanks @clairernovotny — [#107](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/pull/107)
- **Ralph receipt gate hardened** — review receipts now require `type`, `id`, and `verdict` (SHIP/NEEDS_WORK/MAJOR_RETHINK). Catches variable-based receipt writes (`printf ... > "$RECEIPT_PATH"`) that previously bypassed the guard. Defense in depth: pre-tool-use checks command text, Stop handler validates actual file on disk.
- **Ralph prompt templates** — all three templates (`prompt_plan.md`, `prompt_work.md`, `prompt_completion.md`) now include `"verdict":"SHIP"` in receipt JSON. Review workflows capture response and extract verdict from `<verdict>` tags.

### Added
- `run_rp_cli_unchecked` — graceful rp-cli runner for oracle_send fallback detection
- `ralph-receipt-guard.sh` — shell-level receipt validation with verdict + type/id cross-checking
- CI test coverage: oracle_send modern/legacy/error paths, receipt bypass patterns, receipt validation

## [flow-next 0.29.2] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **RepoPrompt 2.1.4 `Context:` builder output** — `flowctl rp builder` / `flowctl rp setup-review` now accept the new `Context: <uuid>` text format and `context_id`/`context`/`contextId` JSON keys alongside the legacy `Tab:` / `tab_id` shapes. Downstream `--tab` flag unchanged; legacy paths still tried first for backward compat. CI regression coverage added. Thanks @clairernovotny — [#106](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/pull/106)

## [flow-next 0.29.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **RepoPrompt workspace leak in setup-review** — Ralph sessions with `WORK_REVIEW=rp` could accumulate dozens of duplicate RepoPrompt workspaces/windows for the same repo when window matching fell through to `workspace create --new-window` on every retry. Now falls back through three layers: `bind_context` (RP's native repo-path matching, newest API) → workspace inventory lookup by repo path → last-resort creation. Hidden workspaces are reopened via `manage_workspaces switch` instead of duplicated. Thanks @clairernovotny — [#104](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/pull/104)
- **`parse_builder_tab` tolerates JSON-shaped responses** — now tries regex patterns (`Tab:`, `T=`, `"tab_id"`, `"tab"`) then falls back to recursive JSON walking before failing. No more fatal errors on newer RP response shapes.
- **`parse_manage_workspaces` unwraps nested result objects** — handles `{"result": {"workspaces": [...]}}` JSON-RPC style payloads with bounded recursive unwrapping. String workspace names are preserved as `{"name": item}` dicts instead of dropped.
- **Windows: ralph-guard state file uses `tempfile.gettempdir()`** — hardcoded `/tmp` path resolved to `\tmp\` on Windows and failed. Pre-existing bug exposed by new regression tests.

### Added
- `try_run_rp_cli` — graceful-failure variant of `run_rp_cli` for optional capability probing (e.g. newer RepoPrompt features)
- `bind_context_window` helper — prefers RepoPrompt's native repo-path binding when available, falls back to legacy window/workspace matching
- Regression test coverage for RepoPrompt setup-review: bind_context fast path, visible workspace reuse, hidden workspace reopen, nested result unwrap, string workspace names

## [flow-next 0.29.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **DESIGN.md awareness** — conditional design system integration when Google Stitch DESIGN.md exists
- repo-scout detects and validates DESIGN.md (section headings + hex color heuristic)
- Plan skill writes `## Design context` in frontend task specs with relevant tokens
- Worker reads DESIGN.md sections in Phase 1.5 when design context present
- Prime Pillar 4 DC7 criterion: DESIGN.md exists (informational)
- docs-gap-scout scans for DESIGN.md and .stitch/DESIGN.md
- Quality-auditor checks design token conformance in frontend diffs (advisory)
- Flow-gap-analyst checks design system alignment for UI features (advisory)

### Changed
- Frontend task detection heuristic documented (file extensions, directories, keywords)

## [flow-next 0.28.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Investigation targets** in task specs — plan writes file paths (Required/Optional) workers must read before coding, reducing hallucination and ensuring pattern conformance
- **Requirement coverage** traceability table in epic specs — maps each requirement to covering task(s) with gap justification, maintained by plan-sync on drift
- **Early proof point** in epic specs — identifies which task validates the core approach and what to reconsider if it fails
- **Bidirectional epic-review** — adds code→spec reverse coverage check detecting scope creep (UNDOCUMENTED_ADDITION, LEGITIMATE_SUPPORT, UNRELATED_CHANGE classifications)
- **Pre-implementation search** — worker greps for similar functionality before coding, applies reuse > extend > new decision tree
- **Typed escalation** — structured block messages with 6 categories (SPEC_UNCLEAR, DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED, DESIGN_CONFLICT, SCOPE_EXCEEDED, TOOLING_FAILURE, EXTERNAL_BLOCKED)
- **Confidence qualifiers** — repo-scout and context-scout tag findings as `[VERIFIED]` (tool-confirmed) or `[INFERRED]` (derived from naming/structure)
- **Test budget awareness** — quality-auditor flags disproportionate test generation (>2:1 ratio) and existing test modifications as advisory

### Changed
- **Plan-sync scope** widened to also update `## Requirement coverage` table in epic specs when drift is detected
- **Epic-review prompt** upgraded from two-phase to three-phase (extract requirements → verify implementation → reverse coverage)
- Codex plugin update instructions documented (uninstall → reinstall from repo)

## [flow-next 0.27.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Native Codex plugin support** (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) — Flow-Next is now a first-class Codex plugin discoverable via `/plugins`
- **Codex marketplace discovery** (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) — repo works as a Codex marketplace source
- **Pre-built Codex agents** as `.toml` files with subagent optimizations (`sandbox_mode`, `nickname_candidates`)
- **Pre-built Codex skills** with platform-specific invocation patterns (`$flow-next-plan` instead of `/flow-next:plan`)
- **Codex-compatible hooks** for Ralph mode — Bash tool guard + Stop hook (experimental)
- **`openai.yaml` UI metadata** for Codex app display (brand color, descriptions, default prompts)
- **`scripts/sync-codex.sh`** — build script generates `codex/` directory from canonical Claude Code sources
- **SessionStart hook** for Codex (flow context loading)

### Changed
- **`install-codex.sh` simplified** — 785 → 257 lines; uses pre-built `codex/` files instead of runtime conversion
- **Model mapping updated** — `gpt-5.4-mini` replaces `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` for scanning scouts
- **flowctl path** — installed to `~/.codex/scripts/` (was `~/.codex/bin/`) for consistency
- **`bump.sh`** updates both `.claude-plugin/` and `.codex-plugin/` manifests
- **Setup skill** detects Codex platform and configures project-scoped agents/hooks
- Plugin README updated with native Codex install instructions and skill invocation guide
- **Repo renamed** `gmickel-claude-marketplace` → `flow-next` (GitHub auto-redirects old URLs)

## [flow-next 0.26.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- **Codex model defaults: gpt-5.4 across the board** — review/oracle model upgraded from `gpt-5.2` to `gpt-5.4` (high reasoning). Agent intelligent tier upgraded from `gpt-5.3-codex` to `gpt-5.4` (high reasoning). Fast scouts remain on `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.

### Fixed

- **Codex docs: removed incorrect Ralph support claim** — "What works" section incorrectly listed Ralph autonomous mode. Ralph requires plugin hooks (guard hooks, receipt gating) which Codex doesn't support. Expanded caveats to clarify.

## [flow-next 0.25.0] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Codex reviews: embed files on all platforms** — removed `os.name == "nt"` gate that restricted file embedding to Windows only. On Unix/macOS, Codex wasted its entire turn budget reading files via `sed`/`rg` before producing a verdict (observed 114 shell commands, 3.68M tokens, no verdict on complex epics). Now always embeds changed files with budget-aware fallback: disk reads allowed when embed budget is exceeded. Default `FLOW_CODEX_EMBED_MAX_BYTES` raised from 100KB to 500KB. (Thanks @acebytes — [#93](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/pull/93))

## [flow-next 0.24.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Spec-driven workflow** — "create a spec for X" now has guidance in the CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md snippet installed by `/flow-next:setup`. Creates an epic with structured spec template (Goal & Context, Architecture & Data Models, API Contracts, Edge Cases & Constraints, Acceptance Criteria, Boundaries, Decision Context). Then choose `/flow-next:plan` (task breakdown) or `/flow-next:refine` (refine spec).
- **README: spec-driven entry point** — new "Spec-driven" workflow section in "When to Use What", updated summary table, clarified Spec vs Interview vs Plan boundaries.

> Re-run `/flow-next:setup` to update your project's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md with the new spec guidance.

## [flow-next 0.23.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Browser skill: comprehensive update from upstream agent-browser** — synced with latest `vercel-labs/agent-browser` skill. New features: version check on use, command chaining guidance, `snapshot -i -C` (cursor-interactive), `click --new-tab`, diff commands (snapshot/screenshot/url comparison), annotated screenshots (`--annotate` vision mode), safe JS eval (`--stdin`/`-b`), config file support, session persistence with encryption (`--session-name`), `--auto-connect` for existing Chrome, `--allow-file-access` for local files, iOS Simulator (`-p ios`), timeouts section, `get box`/`get styles`, `drag`/`upload`, video recording, Chrome DevTools profiling.
- **Browser skill: new reference files** — `commands.md` (full command reference), `snapshot-refs.md` (ref lifecycle/notation), `session-management.md` (auto-persistence/encryption/concurrency), `proxy.md` (proxy config/geo-testing/rotating proxies).
- **Browser skill: updated references** — `auth.md` (OAuth/SSO, 2FA, token refresh, security best practices), `debugging.md` (video recording, profiling), `advanced.md` (auto-connect, extensions, env vars, eval stdin/base64).

## [flow-next 0.22.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **RP `--create` fails on empty default window** — when only an empty RP window exists (no folder loaded), `setup-review --create` reused it instead of creating a workspace with the repo folder, causing "No workspace open" from the builder. Now falls through to workspace creation.

## [flow-next 0.22.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Codex: ensure `multi_agent` at TOML root** — `generate_config_entries` appended `multi_agent = true` at end of config.toml, which landed inside a preceding table instead of at root scope. Now prepended before any `[table]` header.
- **Codex: deduplicate `[agents]` table** — installer always emitted a fresh `[agents]` declaration; if user already had one, the resulting file was invalid TOML. Now checks before declaring.
- **Codex: patch prime workflow for multi-agent** — `Task flow-next:<scout>` references in prime's workflow.md were not converted to Codex role names, causing "Scout availability partial" (only 4/9 scouts resolved). All 9 scouts now patched.
- **Codex: escape backslashes in TOML agent configs** — agent markdown containing regex patterns (`\.env`, `\[test\]`) broke TOML `"""` strings. Backslashes now auto-escaped.

### Added

- **RP auto-create workspace** — all `setup-review` calls now pass `--create`, so RepoPrompt auto-opens a workspace + window if none matches the repo root (RP 1.5.68+).
- **Codex multi-agent roles** — complete rewrite of `install-codex.sh` for Codex 0.102.0+: `.md` agents → `.toml` role configs, 3-tier model mapping (intelligent/smart scouts/fast scouts), `agents-md-scout` rename, prime/plan/work skill patching.
- **Codex install docs** — clone instructions, 3-tier model mapping table, override examples.

## [flow-next 0.22.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Fix receipt-reset false positive on codex reviews** — PostToolUse receipt-write detection matched codex commands containing `--receipt` path + `>` chars in stdout (from `<verdict>` tags), causing `chat_send_succeeded` and `codex_review_succeeded` to reset immediately after being set. Receipt-write detection now uses proper shell redirect pattern matching (same regexes as PreToolUse) instead of naive substring checks. (thanks @clairernovotny for reporting)

### Added

- **Block self-modification of workflow files** — Ralph can no longer Edit/Write to `ralph-guard.py`, `flowctl.py`, `flowctl`, or `hooks.json` during a run. Hooks config now registers `Edit|Write` matcher in addition to `Bash|Execute`. Prevents agents from bypassing guards by editing their own tooling. (ralph-guard v0.13.0)

## [flow-next 0.21.0] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Upgrade scout agents from Haiku to Sonnet 4.6** — All 11 lightweight scout agents (build, claude-md, docs-gap, env, epic, memory, observability, security, testing, tooling, workflow) now use `claude-sonnet-4-6` (pinned) instead of `haiku`. Sonnet 4.6 brings improved reasoning, instruction following, and a training data cutoff of Jan 2026. Requires Claude Code 2.1.45+.

## [flow-next 0.20.21] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- **github-scout now opt-in** — Disabled by default (`scouts.github: false`). Enable via `/flow-next:setup` or `flowctl config set scouts.github true`. Reduces planning cost and removes `gh` CLI requirement for users who don't need cross-repo search.

## [flow-next 0.20.20] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Review skills: prevent double context build** — Reordered RP workflow in impl-review, plan-review, and epic-review to run context-gathering before setup-review. Builder now runs once with a real summary instead of a placeholder. Added guardrails against re-running setup-review.

## [flow-next 0.20.19] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Project-local ralph-guard for cross-platform hooks** — Hooks now reference `scripts/ralph/hooks/ralph-guard.py` (project-local) instead of plugin root variables. ralph-init copies the guard script during setup. Existence check ensures silent exit if ralph not initialized. Works on both Claude Code and Factory Droid without any plugin root variables.

## [flow-next 0.20.18] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Hooks: shell check for cross-platform** — Hook commands now use `[ -n "${VAR}" ] && ...` to skip execution when the platform's variable isn't set. Eliminates noisy "file not found" errors from the other platform's unexpanded variable.

> **Note:** v0.20.10–0.20.18 added Factory Droid compatibility. If you experience issues on Claude Code, downgrade to v0.20.9: `claude plugins install flow-next@0.20.9`

## [flow-next 0.20.17] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Hooks: duplicate entries for cross-platform** — Droid doesn't support bash fallback syntax in hook commands. Now uses separate entries for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Each platform expands its own variable; the other fails silently.

## [flow-next 0.20.16] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Full cross-platform variable support** — Hooks and skills now use `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` bash fallback pattern. Works on both Claude Code and Factory Droid without duplication. Hook matchers use `Bash|Execute` regex for both platforms.

## [flow-next 0.20.15] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Restore read-only scout permissions** — v0.20.14 inadvertently gave all agents Edit/Write access. Now scouts use `disallowedTools: Edit, Write, Task` to maintain read-only restrictions while staying cross-platform compatible (no whitelist of tool names that differ between Claude Code and Droid).

## [flow-next 0.20.14] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Full Droid compatibility** — Removed explicit `tools:` field from all agents. Both platforms now inherit their native tools automatically. Fixes "partially loaded" issue on Factory Droid caused by unknown tool names (`WebFetch`/`FetchUrl`, `Bash`/`Execute`).

## [flow-next 0.20.13] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Droid Bash/Execute compatibility** — Added `Execute` alongside `Bash` in 18 agents. Droid uses `Execute`, Claude Code uses `Bash` — now both work.

## [flow-next 0.20.12] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Droid agent tool compatibility** — Added `FetchUrl` alongside `WebFetch` in 7 agents (context-scout, docs-scout, flow-gap-analyst, github-scout, practice-scout, quality-auditor, repo-scout). Droid uses `FetchUrl`, Claude Code uses `WebFetch` — now both work.

## [flow-next 0.20.11] - 2026-02-03

### Changed

- **Marketplace reorder** — flow-next now listed first (Droid auto-installs first plugin when adding marketplace)

## [flow-next 0.20.10] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Factory Droid compatibility** — Plugin version checks now work on both Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/`) and Factory Droid (`.factory-plugin/`). Skills gracefully handle either directory structure.

## [flow-next 0.20.9] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Cleaner Ralph branch names** — Branch format changed from `ralph-20260203T143000Z-hostname-email-pid-rand` to `ralph-20260203-143000-rand`. Removes PII (hostname, email) and noise (PID) from git history. Full verbose ID preserved in logs for debugging. Thanks to [@aleparreira](https://github.com/aleparreira) for the report! (#90)

### Added

- **ZSH-safe file truncation helper** — Added `truncate_file()` function using `: > "$file"` pattern for portable file truncation across bash/zsh/sh. Prevents potential hangs on macOS (ZSH default since Catalina).

## [flow-next 0.20.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Double context builder in reviews** — SKILL.md files for epic-review, impl-review, and plan-review no longer contain duplicate executable code. Now explicitly direct agent to workflow.md as single source of truth. Fixes issue where agent would run setup-review and chat-send twice.

### Changed

- **Codex install script improvements**:
  - Agents now installed to `~/.codex/agents/` with frontmatter converted to Codex format (`profile`, `approval_policy`, `sandbox_mode`)
  - `flow-next-work` skill patched to inline worker phases (Codex lacks Task tool for subagents)
  - Added timeout warnings for `setup-review` (5-10 min) and `chat-send` (2-5 min) commands

## [flow-next 0.20.7] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **Epic ID collision prevention** — `scan_max_epic_id` now scans both `epics/*.json` and `specs/*.md` to catch orphaned specs created outside flowctl. Prevents reusing numeric IDs when specs exist without matching epic JSON.
- **Collision detection in validate** — `flowctl validate --all` now detects and reports epic ID collisions (multiple epics with same `fn-N` prefix) as errors.
- **Orphaned spec warnings** — `flowctl validate --all` warns about specs without matching epic JSON files.

## [flow-next 0.20.5] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- **Duplicate skill/command listings** — Skills that have command stubs now set `user-invocable: false` to hide from `/` menu. Commands remain the user-facing entry points; skills still work when Claude invokes them.

## [flow-next 0.20.4] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **`epic set-title` command** — Rename epics by updating title and slug: `flowctl epic set-title fn-1-old --title "New Title"`. Renames all related files, updates task references and `depends_on_epics` in other epics.

## [flow-next 0.20.3] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- **Readable epic IDs** — Epic IDs now use slugified titles instead of random suffixes. `fn-23-zgk` → `fn-23-readable-epic-ids`. Random 3-char suffix only used as fallback for empty/special-char titles. Existing IDs remain fully compatible.

### Updated

- All error messages and CLI help strings to show new slug format examples
- TUI regex patterns to accept slug-based IDs
- Skill docs with new ID format examples

## [flow-next 0.20.2] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **`task set-deps` command** — Set multiple task dependencies in one call: `flowctl task set-deps fn-1.3 --deps fn-1.1,fn-1.2`. Convenience wrapper for `dep add` that matches the `--deps` syntax from `task create`.

## [flow-next 0.20.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Epic dependency visualization skill** — New `flow-next-deps` skill shows epic dependency graphs, blocking chains, and execution phases. Triggers on "what's blocking", "execution order", "critical path", "which epics can run in parallel". Uses flowctl for data access with jq-based phase computation. Thanks [@clairernovotny](https://github.com/clairernovotny)! (PR #85)

### Fixed

- **Skill count sync** — Updated manifest descriptions to reflect actual counts (20 subagents, 11 commands, 16 skills).

## [flow-next 0.20.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Epic-completion review gate** — New `/flow-next:epic-review` skill runs when all epic tasks complete, before epic closes. Two-phase review (extract requirements → verify coverage) catches gaps that per-task impl-review misses: decomposition gaps, cross-task requirements, scope drift. Supports RepoPrompt and Codex backends. Closes #83.

- **flowctl commands** — `codex completion-review` for LLM-driven epic review, `epic set-completion-review-status` for manual status control, `--require-completion-review` selector flag.

- **Ralph integration** — `COMPLETION_REVIEW` config (rp/codex/none), gating in `maybe_close_epics()`, `status=completion_review` handler, `prompt_completion.md` template.

- **ralph-guard support** — Parses `completion-fn-N.json` receipt pattern, tracks `flowctl codex completion-review` calls, routes stop-hook to `/flow-next:epic-review`.

- **Work skill update** — `/flow-next:work` now handles `completion_review` status after all tasks complete.

### Changed

- **README callouts** — Replaced `/flow-next:prime` callout with `/flow-next:epic-review`. Removed "Stable features" line (now baseline).

## [flow-next 0.19.1] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Plan skill scout enforcement** — Added CRITICAL block requiring ALL scouts to run in parallel during planning. Previously, agents would skip scouts "because they seem most relevant", causing incomplete plans missing external docs, epic dependencies, and practice pitfalls.

- **Task dependency guidance** — Updated steps.md to document existing `--deps` flag on `task create`. Removes incorrect guidance that said flag didn't exist. Shows preferred inline dependency declaration vs separate `dep add` calls.

## [flow-next 0.19.0] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Worker review enforcement** — Phase 4 header now reads "MANDATORY if REVIEW_MODE != none" with clearer instruction that worker must invoke `/flow-next:impl-review` and receive SHIP verdict before proceeding to Phase 5. Addresses issue where worker would skip review phase entirely.

- **Stop hook guidance improved** — When worker tries to stop without completing review, the ralph-guard hook now tells the worker to invoke the review skill (`/flow-next:impl-review` or `/flow-next:plan-review`) instead of providing a command to manually write the receipt. This prevents bypassing the actual review and allows the worker to correct in-context without a full retry.

### Fixed

- **Worker skipping impl-review** — Fixed issue where worker subagent would complete implementation, run `flowctl done`, and return without invoking `/flow-next:impl-review` when `REVIEW_MODE` was `rp` or `codex`. This caused Ralph to block on missing receipt, force retries, and eventually auto-block tasks after 5 attempts. Thanks [@tiagoefreitas](https://github.com/tiagoefreitas)! (PR #81)

### Migration

This release modifies ralph-guard hook behavior. If you encounter issues:
1. Report at https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues
2. Downgrade: `claude plugins uninstall flow-next && claude plugins add https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next && claude plugins install flow-next@0.18.27`

## [flow-next 0.18.27] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **`--config` flag for Ralph** — Specify alternate config file: `ralph.sh --config my-codex-config.env`. Enables different configs for different platforms/review backends without editing config.env. Closes #82.

## [flow-next 0.18.26] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Version check warning in Ralph** — Ralph now checks if local setup version differs from plugin version at startup. Shows warning: "Plugin updated to vX.Y.Z. Run /flow-next:setup to refresh local scripts (current: vA.B.C)." Non-blocking, warn only.

## [flow-next 0.18.25] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **Block Explore auto-delegation in Ralph mode** — Worker subagent has `disallowedTools: Task` but enforcement is inconsistent (known Claude Code bugs #21295, #21296). When Explore was auto-spawned, it failed with READ-ONLY constraint and couldn't write receipts, causing infinite retry loops. Now explicitly block `Task(Explore)` at CLI level in ralph.sh (precedence 2 beats agent frontmatter precedence 6). Interactive mode unaffected - fix only applies to Ralph autonomous sessions.

## [flow-next 0.18.24] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Epic dependency race condition** — Move `maybe_close_epics()` before selector in Ralph loop. Previously, dependent epics remained blocked when parent epic completed because closing happened after selector returned `NO_WORK`. Now epics close at iteration start, unblocking dependents immediately. Thanks [@tiagoefreitas](https://github.com/tiagoefreitas)! (#79)

## [flow-next 0.18.23] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Plan Review Gate documentation** — Comprehensive docs for Ralph's plan review gate: how it works, configuration matrix, review cycle, checkpoint recovery, status inspection, and comparison with impl review. Added troubleshooting for common issues: plan review never starts, blocked forever, dependent epics not starting.

## [flow-next 0.18.22] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Ralph plan prompt aligned with skill** — Added checkpoint save before plan review, task spec sync mention, and checkpoint restore on context compaction. Ensures Ralph plan gate has same recovery capabilities as interactive `/flow-next:plan-review`.

## [flow-next 0.18.21] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Backend spec fields for tasks and epics** — New optional `impl`, `review`, `sync` fields on tasks and `default_impl`, `default_review`, `default_sync` on epics. These fields store preferred AI backend + model specs (e.g., `codex:gpt-5.2-high`, `claude:opus`). Pure storage - flowctl doesn't interpret them; orchestration products like flow-swarm use them to route different tasks to different backends.

- **`flowctl task set-backend`** — Set backend specs on a task: `flowctl task set-backend fn-1.1 --impl codex:gpt-5.2-high --review claude:opus`

- **`flowctl epic set-backend`** — Set default backend specs on an epic: `flowctl epic set-backend fn-1 --impl codex:gpt-5.2-codex`

- **`flowctl task show-backend`** — Query effective backend specs for a task (task + epic levels): `flowctl task show-backend fn-1.1 --json`

**Note:** These fields have no effect on current flow-next/Ralph usage. They enable an upcoming orchestration product where different tasks can use different backends (complex refactors → expensive reasoning models, simple fixes → fast cheap models).

## [flow-next 0.18.20] - 2026-01-26

### Changed

- **Task sizing: M is the sweet spot** — Updated plan skill to prefer M-sized tasks over many S tasks. Sequential S tasks should be combined into M tasks. Added "7+ tasks = look for tasks to combine" heuristic.

- **OAuth example: 4 tasks → 2 tasks** — Task breakdown example now shows combining sequential backend work into one M task + separate frontend S task. Added "over-split" anti-pattern example.

- **Plan review checks for over-splitting** — Added "Task sizing" as review criterion #8: flags 7+ tasks or sequential S tasks that should be combined.

- **Interview balances split vs combine** — Architecture questions now probe both: "can tasks touch disjoint files?" AND "can sequential steps be combined into M-sized tasks?"

## [flow-next 0.18.19] - 2026-01-26

### Changed

- **Memory and Plan-Sync enabled by default** — New projects now have `memory.enabled: true` and `planSync.enabled: true` out of the box. Cross-epic sync remains disabled by default to avoid long Ralph loops. Disable with `flowctl config set memory.enabled false` or `flowctl config set planSync.enabled false`.

## [flow-next 0.18.18] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- **Preserve GH-73 COMPLETE handling fix** — PR #74 inadvertently reverted the fix for premature completion in Ralph. Workers should NEVER output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` (prompts forbid it); completion is detected via selector returning `status=none`. Restored the ignore-and-log behavior.

### Documentation

- **Improved `--files` guidance in plan-review skills** — Added explanation of how to identify which files to pass (read epic spec, find affected paths) instead of just a hardcoded example.

## [flow-next 0.18.17] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- **Filter artifact files using is_task_id() validation** — Replaced weak `"." not in task_id` check with proper `is_task_id()` regex validation. Fixes `KeyError: 'title'` crash when `.flow/tasks/` contains artifact files like `fn-1.2-review.json`. Works with both legacy (`fn-3.1`) and new (`fn-3-sds.1`) ID formats. Thanks to @kirillzh for the contribution!

## [flow-next 0.18.16] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Parallelization guidance for task splitting** — Plan skill now includes guidance to minimize file overlap when splitting tasks. Tasks touching disjoint files can be worked in parallel without merge conflicts.

- **Plan-review parallelizability criterion** — Added "Parallelizability" as review criterion #3: flags independent tasks that touch overlapping files.

- **Interview probe for parallel work** — Architecture questions now include "Can this be split so tasks touch disjoint files?"

## [flow-next 0.18.15] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

- **Restored manual prompt building for RP reviews** — Reverted from the flaky two-step chat approach (`--response-type review` + follow-up) back to the reliable single-chat approach with custom review prompts.

  **Why this was necessary:**
  - The `--response-type review` mode introduced in 0.14.0 delegates prompt construction to RepoPrompt's builder, giving us no control over the exact prompt sent to the reviewer model
  - RP returns its own verdict format (`request-changes`, `approve`, etc.) instead of our `<verdict>SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>` tags
  - This required a follow-up message just to get the verdict in the correct format, making the flow fragile
  - Versions 0.18.5 through 0.18.12 were all attempts to patch this two-step flow, adding warnings, stronger instructions, and format reminders — none fully resolved the flakiness
  - In autonomous operation (Ralph), this unreliability breaks the review loop entirely when the model skips the follow-up or misparses the builder's verdict

  **What changed:**
  - Removed `--response-type review` from `setup-review` calls
  - Restored Phase 2 manual file selection (explicitly add changed files)
  - Restored Phase 3 `prompt-get` + custom review prompt with full Carmack criteria and verdict requirement baked in
  - Single `chat-send --new-chat` returns verdict directly — no follow-up needed

  **What was preserved:**
  - MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS=3 (reduced from 5)
  - Checkpoint save/restore for context compaction recovery
  - Task spec inclusion and syncing in plan-review
  - All flowctl.py improvements (`--chat-id`, `--mode`, etc. remain available)

## [flow-next 0.18.14] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

- **Codex sandbox on Windows blocking all reads** — Codex CLI's `read-only` sandbox uses Windows AppContainer which blocks ALL shell commands, including file reads. Added `--sandbox` flag to `flowctl codex impl-review` and `flowctl codex plan-review` with `auto` mode that resolves to `danger-full-access` on Windows and `read-only` on Unix. Added `CODEX_SANDBOX` config option for Ralph. Full file contents are now embedded in review prompts to work around sandbox limitations.

### ⚠️ Breaking Change: `--files` required for `flowctl codex plan-review`

`flowctl codex plan-review` now requires `--files` (comma-separated **code** file paths) so the reviewer has concrete repository context (and so Windows can embed file contents when the Codex sandbox blocks reads).

Migration: update any scripts to pass `--files`, e.g. `--files "src/auth.ts,src/config.ts"`.

### Added

- **`--sandbox` flag for codex commands** — Supports `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`, and `auto` modes
- **`CODEX_SANDBOX` config option for Ralph** — Configure sandbox mode in `scripts/ralph/config.env` (default: `auto`)
- **Exit code 3 for sandbox errors** — flowctl returns exit code 3 for sandbox configuration issues

### Documentation

- flowctl.md: Added `--sandbox` flag documentation for both impl-review and plan-review
- flowctl.md: Documented `--files` requirement for plan-review
- ralph.md: Added `CODEX_SANDBOX` config option with valid values
- ralph.md: Added troubleshooting section for "blocked by policy" errors
- CLAUDE.md: Added Windows sandbox note in Codex section

**Note:** Re-run `/flow-next:setup` or `/flow-next:ralph-init` after plugin update to get sandbox fixes.

## [flow-next 0.18.13] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Ralph exits early on NEEDS_WORK despite force_retry** — Worker returns `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` after marking task done. Ralph checked for COMPLETE *after* setting `force_retry=1` for NEEDS_WORK, causing premature exit. Now skips COMPLETE exit when `force_retry=1`.

## [flow-next 0.18.12] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Agent skipping verdict follow-up** — Added ⚠️ WARNING block after Step 2 explicitly stating RP's verdict is INVALID and Step 4 is MANDATORY. Agent was seeing builder's `request-changes` verdict and jumping to fix loop without sending the follow-up to get our verdict format.

## [flow-next 0.18.11] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **RP uses its own verdict format** — Builder's `response_type=review` returns RP's verdict format (`request-changes`, `approve`, etc.) not ours. Updated instructions to explicitly IGNORE builder verdict and extract verdict ONLY from the follow-up chat response. Added clearer verdict tag requirements with "Do NOT use any other verdict format."

## [flow-next 0.18.10] - 2026-01-23

### Changed

- **Stronger workflow.md references** — Changed "Read workflow.md" to "⚠️ MANDATORY: Read workflow.md BEFORE executing RP backend steps" and "⚠️ STOP: Read workflow.md NOW" to ensure agents follow the link. SKILL.md is a summary; workflow.md has the complete flow.

## [flow-next 0.18.9] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Missing verdict follow-up step in SKILL.md** — Builder returns review findings but NOT a verdict tag. Added explicit follow-up chat step to request verdict in both impl-review and plan-review SKILL.md files. Without this, Ralph breaks waiting for a verdict that never comes.

## [flow-next 0.18.8] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **plan-review also missing --response-type review** — Same fix as 0.18.7 but for plan-review skill. Updated SKILL.md, workflow.md, and flowctl-reference.md.

## [flow-next 0.18.7] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **impl-review SKILL.md missing --response-type review** — The actual bug was in SKILL.md which agents read. The example setup-review call was missing `--response-type review`, causing RP to use default "clarify" mode instead of "review" mode.

## [flow-next 0.18.6] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **rp-cli builder --type flag** — Use `--type review` (shorthand flag) instead of `response_type=review` (key=value). Turns out both work, but the real issue was SKILL.md - see 0.18.7.

## [flow-next 0.18.5] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **rp-cli builder response_type format** — Changed from invalid `--response-type review` to `response_type=review`. Still didn't work - see 0.18.6.

- **Added verdict requirement to review instructions** — The builder review instructions now explicitly request a verdict tag (`<verdict>SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>`), ensuring consistent verdict output from RP reviews.

- **Fixed cli-reference.md** — Updated rp-cli example to use `--type` shorthand instead of invalid `--response-type` flag.

## [flow-next 0.18.4] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Ralph now auto-closes epics in unscoped runs** — Previously `maybe_close_epics()` only ran when `EPICS=...` was specified, meaning unscoped Ralph runs would never auto-close epics even when all tasks were done. This blocked downstream epics that depended on them. Now Ralph checks all open epics and closes any with all tasks completed. Thanks to [@VexyCats](https://github.com/VexyCats) for the report!

- **Added `list_open_epics()` helper** — New function to get all non-done epic IDs from flowctl for unscoped runs.

## [flow-next 0.18.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Ralph now enforces receipt verdict** — Previously Ralph only checked that impl-review receipts existed but ignored the `verdict` field. Now Ralph reads the verdict from the receipt file and forces a retry if `NEEDS_WORK`, even if the worker marked the task as done. This fixes issue #70 where NEEDS_WORK verdicts from Codex reviews were being ignored. Thanks to [@VexyCats](https://github.com/VexyCats) for the detailed report!

- **Added `read_receipt_verdict()` helper** — New function in ralph.sh to read the verdict field from receipt JSON files.

## [flow-next 0.18.2] - 2026-01-23

### Changed

- **Expanded `/flow-next:prime` to 8 pillars (48 criteria)** — Now matches Factory.ai's comprehensive assessment:
  - Agent Readiness (Pillars 1-5): Style & Validation, Build System, Testing, Documentation, Dev Environment
  - Production Readiness (Pillars 6-8): Observability, Security, Workflow & Process

- **Two-tier scoring** — Agent Readiness score (determines maturity level, fixes offered) + Production Readiness score (reported only, no fixes). Gives full visibility while keeping remediation focused.

- **3 new scouts** for production readiness:
  - `observability-scout` — Structured logging, tracing, metrics, error tracking, health endpoints
  - `security-scout` — Branch protection, secret scanning, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot (via GitHub API)
  - `workflow-scout` — CI/CD pipelines, PR templates, issue templates, release automation

- **Test verification** — Now runs `pytest --collect-only` (or equivalent) to verify tests actually work, not just that files exist.

- **GitHub API integration** — Uses `gh` CLI to check branch protection, secret scanning status, and repository settings.

## [flow-next 0.18.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **`/flow-next:prime` command** — Agent readiness assessment inspired by Factory.ai's framework. Analyzes your codebase and proposes non-destructive improvements.

- **6 haiku scouts** for fast parallel assessment:
  - `tooling-scout` — Scans linters, formatters, pre-commit hooks, type checking
  - `claude-md-scout` — Analyzes CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md quality and completeness
  - `env-scout` — Checks .env.example, Docker, devcontainer, setup scripts
  - `testing-scout` — Evaluates test framework, coverage config, test commands
  - `build-scout` — Reviews build system, scripts, CI configuration
  - `docs-gap-scout` — README, ADRs, architecture docs

- **Maturity levels 1-5** — Repositories scored from Minimal (1) to Autonomous (5). Level 3 (Standardized) is the recommended target for most teams.

- **Interactive remediation** — After assessment, offers to fix gaps with user consent via AskUserQuestion. Supports `--report-only` (skip fixes) and `--fix-all` (apply all without asking).

- **Remediation templates** — Built-in templates for common fixes: CLAUDE.md, .env.example, pre-commit hooks, and more.

### Technical Details

The prime workflow:
1. Runs scouts in parallel (fast, ~15-20 seconds)
2. Synthesizes findings into a readiness report with pillar scores
3. Uses AskUserQuestion for each category of improvements
4. Applies approved fixes non-destructively (never overwrites without consent)
5. Offers re-assessment to show improvement

Works for both greenfield and brownfield projects.

## [flow-next 0.17.4] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **Bash `!=` operator in skill markdown** — Version check in `/flow-next:plan` and `/flow-next:refine` was failing with syntax error when Claude Code parsed the bash code blocks. The `!` character was being escaped to `\!` during processing. Rewrote conditionals to avoid `!=` operator. Thanks @clairedotcom for reporting (#68).

## [flow-next 0.17.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility** — `fcntl` import now conditional; was causing `ModuleNotFoundError` on Windows since 0.17.0. File locking gracefully degrades to no-op on Windows (acceptable for single-machine use).

## [flow-next 0.17.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Plan review now includes task specs** — `/flow-next:plan-review` previously reviewed only the epic spec, leaving task specs stale when epic changes occurred during the fix loop. Now both RP and Codex backends include task specs in the review. Reviewers can flag inconsistencies between epic and task specs, and the fix loop instructs the agent to sync affected task specs.

### Added

- **`task set-spec --file`** — Full spec replacement mode for task specs (like `epic set-plan --file`). Supports both file paths and stdin (`-`). Use in plan-review fix loops to sync task specs after epic changes.
- **Consistency checking in review criteria** — Both plan review backends now explicitly check for epic/task consistency: contradicting requirements, misaligned acceptance criteria, stale state/enum references.
- **Task sync instructions in re-review preamble** — When re-reviewing, Codex backend now instructs the agent to sync task specs if epic changes affected them.

### Changed

- **Review prompt expanded** — Plan review now includes `<task_specs>` section with all task spec content (Codex backend). RP backend adds task spec files to selection.
- **Fix loop steps updated** — Both SKILL.md and workflow.md now include task spec sync as explicit step (step 3 in SKILL.md, step 4 in workflow.md) before re-review.
- **Anti-pattern added** — "Updating epic spec without syncing affected task specs" documented as anti-pattern in workflow.md.

### Technical Details

Task specs need syncing when epic changes affect:
- State/enum values referenced in tasks
- Acceptance criteria that tasks implement
- Approach/design decisions tasks depend on
- Lock/retry/error handling semantics
- API signatures or type definitions

## [flow-next 0.17.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Shared runtime state for parallel worktree execution** — Task runtime state (status, assignee, claim info, evidence) now lives in `.git/flow-state/` instead of the tracked definition files. This enables multiple git worktrees to share task state, unlocking parallel orchestration workflows where different agents work on different tasks simultaneously.

- **StateStore abstraction** — New `LocalFileStateStore` with per-task `fcntl` locking prevents race conditions when multiple processes claim or update tasks concurrently.

- **New commands**:
  - `flowctl state-path` — Shows resolved state directory (useful for debugging)
  - `flowctl migrate-state [--clean]` — Migrates existing repos to the new state model. `--clean` removes runtime fields from tracked JSON files after migration.

- **Checkpoint schema v2** — Checkpoints now include runtime state, enabling full restore across worktrees.

### Changed

- **Merged read path** — All task reads now merge definition + runtime state.
- **Atomic task claiming** — `flowctl start` validates and writes under the same lock, eliminating TOCTOU race conditions.
- **Reset semantics** — `flowctl task reset` now properly clears runtime state (overwrite, not merge).

### Backward Compatibility

**No action required.** Existing repos work without any migration. The merged read path automatically falls back to reading runtime fields from definition files when no state file exists. Migration is only needed if you want to:
- Use parallel worktree orchestration
- Stop tracking runtime state in git (cleaner diffs)

### Technical Details

State directory resolution order:
1. `FLOW_STATE_DIR` environment variable (explicit override)
2. `git --git-common-dir` + `/flow-state` (worktree-aware, shared)
3. `.flow/state` fallback (non-git or old git)

Runtime fields moved to state: `status`, `updated_at`, `assignee`, `claimed_at`, `claim_note`, `evidence`, `blocked_reason`

## [flow-next 0.16.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Epic-aware planning** — New `epic-scout` subagent runs during `/flow-next:plan` research phase (parallel with other scouts). Scans open epics for dependency relationships and auto-sets `depends_on_epics` when found. No user prompts needed — findings reported at end of planning.
- **Docs-gap detection** — New `docs-gap-scout` subagent identifies documentation that may need updates (README, API docs, ADRs, CHANGELOG, etc.). Adds acceptance criteria to relevant tasks — implementer decides actual content.
- **Cross-epic plan-sync** — Optional mode for plan-sync agent. When `planSync.crossEpic: true`, also checks other open epics for stale references after task completion. **Default: false** (avoids long Ralph loops).
- **New config option** — `planSync.crossEpic` (boolean, default false). Enable via `/flow-next:setup` or `flowctl config set planSync.crossEpic true`.

### Changed

- Plan-sync agent now accepts `CROSS_EPIC` input and has new Phase 4b for cross-epic checking
- Setup workflow shows new cross-epic config option (only asked if plan-sync is enabled)
- `memory-scout` model changed from opus to haiku (task is mechanical grep/read, doesn't need reasoning)

### Notes

- **Re-run `/flow-next:setup`** to get the new config option and update local flowctl
- Cross-epic sync is conservative — only flags clear API/pattern references, not general topic overlap

## [flow-next 0.15.0] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **WORKER_TIMEOUT default** — 45min → 1hr (3600s). Timeout is now a safety guard against runaway workers, not flow control. Properly sized tasks shouldn't hit it ([#59](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/59))
- **MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS default** — 5 → 3. Tighter cap; if 3 fix cycles don't pass review, task/spec is likely too big or ambiguous. Let next Ralph iteration start fresh
- **Timeout philosophy** — Docs and comments now clarify: time is arbitrary, `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` is the real control. One Ralph iteration = impl + review, should complete within single context window

## [flow-next 0.14.4] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Version mismatch warning** — `/flow-next:plan` and `/flow-next:refine` now check if local setup is outdated. If `.flow/meta.json` has older `setup_version` than plugin, prints: "Plugin updated to vX.Y.Z. Run /flow-next:setup to refresh local scripts." Non-blocking, continues normally.

## [flow-next 0.14.3] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Setup skips already-configured options** — Re-running `/flow-next:setup` now detects existing config (memory, planSync, review.backend) and skips those questions. Shows current config with `flowctl config set` commands for changing values.
- **Review backend descriptions improved** — RepoPrompt now highlights auto-scoped diffs and ~65% fewer tokens; Codex notes cross-platform + GPT 5.2 High. No "(Recommended)" — user decides based on platform/needs.

## [flow-next 0.14.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Task-level interview guard** — When interviewing a task (fn-N.M) that already has planning content (file refs, sizing, approach), interview now preserves that detail instead of overwriting. Only acceptance criteria can be appended, or user is directed to interview the epic instead.

## [flow-next 0.14.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Interview skill boundary ambiguity** — Interview was creating full implementation plans with tasks, conflicting with `/flow-next:plan`. Now:
  - Interview creates epic with refined requirements only (problem, decisions, edge cases)
  - Interview does NOT create tasks — that's plan's job
  - When interviewing an epic that already has tasks, only the epic spec is updated
  - Clear "NOT in scope" section lists what belongs in plan vs interview

### Changed

- **Epic spec template** — Renamed "Approach" → "Key Decisions" + added "Open Questions" section to clarify interview captures requirements, not implementation approach
- **Input-type routing** — Interview now handles different inputs differently:
  - New idea → create epic stub, suggest `/flow-next:plan`
  - Existing epic with tasks → update epic spec only, don't touch tasks
  - Task ID → update task requirements only
  - File path → rewrite file, suggest `/flow-next:plan <file>`
- **README clarification** — Added explicit "Interview vs Plan boundary" note in "When to Use What" section

Thanks to @tiagoefreitas for the detailed issue report ([#62](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/62)).

## [flow-next 0.14.0] - 2026-01-21

### ⚠️ Breaking Change: RepoPrompt 1.6.0+ Required

The RepoPrompt (rp) backend for `/flow-next:impl-review` now uses the new **builder review mode** introduced in RepoPrompt 1.6.0. This provides better context discovery and more focused reviews.

**Before upgrading**: Check your RepoPrompt version with `rp-cli --version`. If you're on an older version, update RepoPrompt first or use `--review=codex` as an alternative.

### Changed

- **RP impl-review uses builder review mode** — Instead of manually building review prompts and selecting files, the builder's discovery agent now:
  - Automatically includes git diffs for the commits being reviewed
  - Selects relevant context files with full codebase awareness
  - Produces structured review findings before verdict
  - Lower token usage (~26K vs ~71K) with better coverage

- **New flowctl rp commands**:
  - `--response-type review` on `rp builder` and `rp setup-review`
  - `--chat-id` on `rp chat-send` for conversation continuity
  - `--mode` on `rp chat-send` (chat/review/plan/edit)

- **Simplified RP workflow** — Removed manual file selection (Phase 2) and elaborate prompt building (Phase 3). Builder handles context discovery; follow-up chat requests verdict.

- **Fix loop uses `--chat-id`** — Re-reviews now use explicit chat ID for session continuity instead of relying on tab state.

### Added

- RP 1.6.0 requirement notice in SKILL.md and workflow.md

### Unchanged

- Codex backend — No changes, works as before
- Plan-review — No changes, only impl-review affected
- Receipt format — Compatible with Ralph

## [flow-next 0.13.0] - 2026-01-19

### ⚠️ Significant Planning Workflow Changes

**The Problem:** Plans were doing implementation work. Epic and task specs contained complete function bodies, full interface definitions, and copy-paste ready code blocks. This caused:

1. **Wasted tokens in planning** — Writing code that won't ship
2. **Wasted tokens in review** — Reviewing code that won't ship
3. **Wasted tokens in implementation** — Re-writing essentially the same code
4. **Plan-sync drift** — Implementer does it slightly differently, specs and reality diverge

Real examples from production plans showed 28KB epic specs with complete TypeScript implementations, and task specs that were literally the code to write — nothing left for `/flow-next:work` to do.

**The Solution:** Plans describe WHAT to build and WHERE to look — not HOW to implement.

### Added

- **"The Golden Rule" in SKILL.md** — Explicit guidance on what code belongs in plans vs. what doesn't
  - ✅ Allowed: Signatures, file:line refs, recent/surprising APIs, non-obvious gotchas
  - ❌ Forbidden: Complete implementations, full class bodies, copy-paste snippets (>10 lines)

- **Task sizing with T-shirt sizes** — Observable metrics instead of token estimates

  | Size | Files | Acceptance | Pattern | Action |
  |------|-------|------------|---------|--------|
  | S | 1-2 | 1-3 | Follows existing | ✅ Good |
  | M | 3-5 | 3-5 | Adapts existing | ✅ Good |
  | L | 5+ | 5+ | New/novel | ⚠️ Split |

  - Anchor examples for calibration (S = fix bug, M = new endpoint with tests, L = split it)
  - Good/bad breakdown examples (e.g., "Implement OAuth" → 4 S/M tasks)

- **Plan depth selection** — Users can now choose detail level upfront
  - `--depth=short` | `--depth=standard` (default) | `--depth=deep`
  - Or answer "1a/1b/1c" in setup questions

- **Follow-up options in Step 7** — After plan creation:
  - Go deeper on specific tasks
  - Simplify (reduce detail)
  - Loop until user chooses work/interview/review

- **Expanded examples.md** — Complete rewrite with:
  - Good vs. bad epic spec examples (side by side)
  - Good vs. bad task spec examples
  - Task breakdown examples
  - When code IS appropriate (with specific triggers)

- **"Current year is 2026" note** — Added to docs-scout, practice-scout, github-scout
  - Ensures web searches target recent documentation

- **Stakeholder analysis step** — New Step 2 asks who's affected (end users, developers, operations)
  - Shapes what the plan needs to cover
  - Pure backend refactor needs different detail than user-facing feature

- **Mermaid diagram guidance** — For data model and architecture changes
  - ERD for new tables/schema changes
  - Flowchart for service architecture
  - Examples in examples.md

### Changed

- **Subagent output rules** — All research scouts now have explicit guidance:
  - Show signatures, not full implementations
  - Keep snippets to <10 lines illustrating the pattern shape
  - Focus on "where to look" not "what to write"

- **"When to include code" heuristic** — Instead of asking models to know their knowledge cutoff (they can't), we use observable signals:
  - Docs say "new in version X" or "changed in version Y"
  - API differs from common/expected patterns
  - Recent releases (2025+) with breaking changes
  - Deprecation warnings or migration guides
  - **Anything that surprised you or contradicted expectations**

  This "surprised you" heuristic works because models CAN notice "this is different from what I'd expect" even if they can't reliably say "this is beyond my training data."

- **Default depth is STANDARD** — Balanced detail; short/deep on request

### Technical Notes

This is a behavior change in planning output. Existing `.flow/` data is fully compatible — only new plans will follow the tighter guidelines.

The changes affect:
- `skills/flow-next-plan/SKILL.md` — Golden Rule, depth selection
- `skills/flow-next-plan/steps.md` — Task sizing, complexity, Step 7 options
- `skills/flow-next-plan/examples.md` — Complete rewrite
- `agents/repo-scout.md` — Output rules
- `agents/context-scout.md` — Output rules
- `agents/practice-scout.md` — Output rules, year note
- `agents/docs-scout.md` — Output rules, year note
- `agents/github-scout.md` — Year note

### Feedback Welcome

This is a significant change to the planning philosophy. If you find plans are now too sparse, or the "surprised you" heuristic isn't working well, please open an issue at https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues

We'd rather iterate based on real usage than guess at the right balance.

### Implementation Review Improvements

**Scenario exploration checklist** — Reviewers now systematically walk through failure scenarios for changed code:

- Happy path (normal operation)
- Invalid inputs (null, empty, malformed)
- Boundary conditions (min/max, empty collections)
- Concurrent access (race conditions, deadlocks)
- Network issues (timeouts, partial failures)
- Resource exhaustion (memory, disk, connections)
- Security attacks (injection, overflow, DoS)
- Data corruption (partial writes, inconsistency)
- Cascading failures (downstream service issues)

**Scope guardrail:** Checklist explicitly scoped to "changed code only" — reviewers flag issues in the changeset, not pre-existing patterns. Reinforces the verdict scope rules added in 0.12.10.

Affects:
- `skills/flow-next-impl-review/workflow.md` (RP backend)
- `scripts/flowctl.py` — `build_review_prompt()` and `build_standalone_review_prompt()` (Codex backend)

## [flow-next 0.12.10] - 2026-01-19

### Changed
- **WORKER_TIMEOUT default increased** - 30min → 45min (2700s) to accommodate complex impl-review loops (#59)
- **Review verdict scope tightened** - Codex impl/plan reviews now focus on issues introduced by the changeset, not pre-existing codebase issues
  - Reviewers may mention tangential issues as "FYI" without affecting verdict
  - Prevents review loops from drifting to unrelated improvements

### Added
- **Iteration tracking in receipts** - Receipts now include `"iteration": N` for debugging timeout/failure patterns
- **Enhanced timeout logging** - Timeouts now log phase, task/epic ID, iteration, and suggest increasing `WORKER_TIMEOUT`

## [flow-next 0.12.9] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Task jumping on timeout** - Prevent tasks from being skipped when worker times out after `flowctl done` but before receipt write (#57)
  - Reset `done→todo` if receipt missing (ensures `flowctl next` picks it up)
  - Fatal abort if reset fails (prevents silent skipping)
  - Delete corrupted/partial receipts on verification failure
- **Timeout retry handling** - Don't count timeouts against `MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_TASK` (infrastructure ≠ code failure)
- **Unnecessary retry on proven completion** - Clear `force_retry` when task done + receipt valid

Thanks to @VexyCats for the detailed analysis and logs that identified the root cause.

## [flow-next 0.12.8] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS env var** - Cap fix+re-review cycles within impl-review (default 5) (#57)
- **WORKER_TIMEOUT documentation** - Now documented in config.env template and ralph.md

### Fixed
- **plan command description** - Removed "clear" to avoid collision with /clear command (#56)

## [flow-next 0.12.7] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Review fix loop no longer prompts user** - plan-review and impl-review now automatically fix all valid issues without asking for confirmation (#55)
  - Goal: production-grade world-class software and architecture
  - Added explicit "Never use AskUserQuestion in this loop" to SKILL.md and workflow.md

## [flow-next 0.12.6] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **github-scout agent** - Cross-repo code search via `gh` CLI
  - Search public + private GitHub repos
  - Quality tiers: Authoritative (★5k+) → Established (★1k+) → Reference (★100+) → Examples
  - Signals: stars, recency, official repos, fork status
- **Enhanced docs-scout** - Source diving when docs fall short
  - Fetch library source via `gh api`
  - Search GitHub issues for known problems
- **Enhanced practice-scout** - Real-world examples from GitHub
  - Quality heuristics table (stars, recency, official = High weight)
  - Cross-reference pattern (2-3 repos = higher confidence)

### Changed
- Research phase now runs `github-scout` in parallel with other scouts
- Subagent count: 7 → 10

### Docs
- Force update tip in README (issue #54)

## [flow-next 0.12.1] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Single-task mode respects input** - `/flow-next:work fn-N.M` now stops after completing that task
  - Previously looped to next task after plan-sync (bug in Phase 3f)
  - Phase 1 now tracks SINGLE_TASK_MODE vs EPIC_MODE
  - Phase 3f only loops in EPIC_MODE; SINGLE_TASK_MODE goes to quality phase

## [flow-next 0.12.0] - 2026-01-16

### ⚠️ Migration Required

**Review backend no longer auto-detects.** Users who relied on automatic `which rp-cli` / `which codex` detection will see behavior changes:

**Why this change:**
- LLMs deviated from instructions, checking wrong binaries (`rp`, `repoprompt` instead of `rp-cli`)
- 12+ redundant subprocess calls per session (same detection in every skill)
- Ralph mode already handled this correctly via config—now all skills do too

| Command | Old behavior | New behavior |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| `/flow-next:plan`, `/flow-next:work` | Auto-detect, pick first available | Asks which backend to use (discovery flow) |
| `/flow-next:impl-review`, `/flow-next:plan-review` | Auto-detect, pick first available | Error if no backend configured |

**To migrate:** Run `/flow-next:setup` once per repo, or pass `--review=rp|codex|none` explicitly.

**Backwards compatible:** All existing `.flow/` data works unchanged. Only review invocation behavior changed.

### Added
- **`flowctl review-backend` command** - Returns explicit `ASK` or configured backend (`rp`/`codex`/`none`)
  - Skills use this instead of complex jq checks
  - LLMs handle explicit string matching better than empty/non-empty checks
  - Reduces LLM deviation on conditional logic

### Changed
- **Remove runtime `which` detection from skills** - Skills no longer auto-detect review backends
  - Removed `which rp-cli` / `which codex` from impl-review, plan-review, work, plan skills
  - Priority order: `--review=X` flag > `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` env > `.flow/config.json` > error
  - Run `/flow-next:setup` to configure preferred backend (one-time)
  - Reduces LLM deviation (agents checking wrong binary names)
  - Reduces subprocess overhead (12+ calls per session)
- **Simplified skill conditionals** - All skills now use `$FLOWCTL review-backend`
  - Check for `ASK` (not configured) vs actual value (configured)
  - No more jq parsing or empty string checks
- **Setup asks review backend** - `/flow-next:setup` now prompts for RepoPrompt/Codex/None
  - Writes to `.flow/config.json` under `review.backend`
  - Shows detection status (detected / not detected) for each option
- **README updated** - Removed "auto-detect" from priority documentation

## [flow-next 0.11.9] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Task-scoped impl-review** - Reviews now only cover current task's changes, not entire branch
  - Worker captures `BASE_COMMIT` before implementing
  - Passes `--base $BASE_COMMIT` to `/flow-next:impl-review`
  - Diff is `BASE_COMMIT..HEAD` instead of `main..HEAD`
  - Prevents re-reviewing already-shipped code from previous tasks
  - Critical for Ralph mode where all tasks share one branch

## [flow-next 0.11.8] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **`/flow-next:sync` command** - Manual plan-sync trigger ([#43](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/43))
  - Sync from task: `/flow-next:sync fn-1.2`
  - Scan whole epic: `/flow-next:sync fn-1`
  - Preview mode: `/flow-next:sync fn-1.2 --dry-run`
  - Ignores `planSync.enabled` config (manual = always run)
  - Works with any source task status (not just done)
- **Dry-run support in plan-sync agent** - Shows proposed changes without writing

### Fixed
- **flowctl tasks/list KeyError** - Task JSON uses `epic` field, not `epic_id`
  - Fixes `flowctl tasks --epic` crash
  - Fixes TUI task fetching on repos with collision-resistant IDs

## [flow-next 0.11.5] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Ralph hooks check removed** - Remove blocking local hooks check from `ralph.sh` ([#45](https://github.com/gmickel/flow-next/issues/45))
  - Plugin hooks work via `hooks/hooks.json` when installed normally
  - The check was blocking ALL users, not just `--plugin-dir` users
  - Test scripts handle the `--plugin-dir` workaround for bug #14410
- **Ralph upgrade support** - `/flow-next:ralph-init` now offers to update existing setup
  - Detects existing `scripts/ralph/` and asks to update
  - Preserves `config.env` and `runs/` during update
  - Existing users: re-run `/flow-next:ralph-init` to get the fix

### Changed
- **Dev guidance** - CLAUDE.md now recommends local marketplace install over `--plugin-dir`
  - `/plugin marketplace add ./` then `/plugin install flow-next@flow-next`
  - Hooks work correctly this way (no workaround needed)
- **Setup notes** - `/flow-next:setup` now mentions `/flow-next:ralph-init` for autonomous mode

## [flow-next 0.11.4] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Plan-sync agent** - Synchronizes downstream task specs when implementation drifts
  - Opt-in via `flowctl config set planSync.enabled true`
  - Runs after each task completes, compares spec vs actual implementation
  - Updates downstream tasks with accurate names, APIs, data structures
  - Skip conditions: disabled (default), task failed, no downstream tasks
  - Agent uses `disallowedTools: Task, Write, Bash` + prompt-based Edit restriction
- New phase 3e in `/flow-next:work` phases.md (between verify and loop)
- `planSync.enabled` config key in flowctl.py
- Smoke test for planSync config
- **Idempotent `flowctl init`** - Safe to re-run, handles upgrades
  - Creates missing dirs/files without destroying existing data
  - Merges new config keys into existing config.json (deep merge)
  - Old configs without `planSync` now work correctly
- **Config deep merge** - `load_flow_config()` merges with defaults
  - Missing keys automatically get default values
  - Existing user values preserved
- `/flow-next:setup` now uses `AskUserQuestion` for all options at once
  - Memory, Plan-Sync, Docs, Star questions in single UI interaction

## [flow-next 0.11.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **flowctl tasks/list commands** - Added guard to skip artifact files lacking required fields (GH-21)

## [flow-next 0.11.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Worker subagent model** - Each task spawns isolated worker for implementation
  - Prevents context bleed between tasks during `/flow-next:work`
  - Re-anchor info stays with implementation (survives compaction)
  - Worker handles: re-anchor → implement → commit → review → complete
  - Main conversation handles task selection and looping only
  - `disallowedTools: Task` prevents infinite subagent nesting
- **Agent colors** - Visual identification in Claude Code UI
  - worker: blue (#3B82F6), repo-scout: green (#22C55E)
  - context-scout: cyan (#06B6D4), practice-scout: yellow (#EAB308)
  - docs-scout: orange (#F97316), memory-scout: purple (#A855F7)
  - flow-gap-analyst: red (#EF4444), quality-auditor: pink (#EC4899)

### Fixed
- **ralph-init efficiency** - Uses `cp -R` instead of read/Write per file
  - Single bash command copies all templates (including dotfiles)
  - Only edits `config.env` for review backend setting
- **Legacy `deps` key migration** - flowctl now handles both `deps` and `depends_on`
  - `normalize_task()` auto-migrates legacy `deps` to `depends_on`
  - Backwards compatible with older task files

## [flow-next 0.10.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Stdin support** (`--file -`) for flowctl commands
  - `epic set-plan`, `task set-description`, `task set-acceptance` now accept `-` to read from stdin
  - Enables heredoc usage: `flowctl epic set-plan fn-1 --file - <<'EOF'`
  - Eliminates temp file creation, solves shell escaping issues
- **Combined task set-spec command**
  - `flowctl task set-spec <id> --description <file> --acceptance <file>`
  - Sets both sections in single call (2 atomic writes vs 4)
- **Checkpoint commands** for compaction recovery
  - `flowctl checkpoint save --epic <id>` - Snapshots epic + all tasks to `.flow/.checkpoint-<id>.json`
  - `flowctl checkpoint restore --epic <id>` - Restores from checkpoint
  - `flowctl checkpoint delete --epic <id>` - Removes checkpoint file

### Changed
- Updated skill files to use stdin heredocs and `task set-spec` where applicable
- Plan-review workflow now saves checkpoint before review (recovery point)
- Added smoke tests for stdin, set-spec, and checkpoint commands

## [flow-next 0.9.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Browser automation skill** - Web testing, form filling, screenshots, scraping via agent-browser CLI
  - Core workflow: snapshot → ref-based interaction (@e1, @e2)
  - Progressive disclosure: main skill + debugging/auth/advanced references
  - Triggers on UI verification, doc lookup, baseline capture, e2e testing
- **Bundled Skills** section in README documenting utility skills

### Fixed

## [flow-next-tui 0.1.2] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Support for collision-resistant epic IDs (`fn-N-xxx` format)
  - Updated runs.ts receipt/block/epic parsing
  - Added tests for new ID format

### Fixed
- Resolved oxlint warnings (useless escapes, control-regex disable comments)

## [flow-next 0.8.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Ralph async control** (GH-14)
  - `flowctl status [--json]` - Show epic/task counts + active Ralph runs
  - `flowctl ralph pause/resume/stop/status [--run <id>]` - Control Ralph runs externally
  - Sentinel file mechanism in ralph.sh (PAUSE/STOP files at iteration boundaries)
  - All exit paths in ralph.sh now write `promise=COMPLETE` marker
- **Task reset command**
  - `flowctl task reset <id> [--cascade]` - Reset done/blocked tasks to todo
  - Clears evidence, claim fields, blocked_reason
  - `--cascade` resets dependent tasks in same epic
- **Epic dependency CLI**
  - `flowctl epic add-dep <epic> <dep>` - Add epic-level dependency
  - `flowctl epic rm-dep <epic> <dep>` - Remove epic-level dependency
- **CI tests** for all new async control commands (40 total, +9 new)

### Fixed
- README Troubleshooting: replaced nonexistent `task set` with `task reset`

## [flow-next 0.7.2] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Windows/Git Bash support** (GH-35, thanks @VexyCats)
  - Python detection: prefer `python3`, fallback to `python` (common on Windows)
  - Windows platform detection (`IS_WINDOWS` flag in ralph.sh)

  - Codex stdin-based prompt passing to avoid Windows CLI length limits (~8191 chars)
- **CI workflow** for cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - flowctl.py syntax and basic command tests
  - ralph.sh syntax and Python detection tests

### Changed
- `smoke_test.sh` and `ralph_smoke_test.sh` now use dynamic Python detection

## [flow-next 0.7.1] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **C# symbol support** in flowctl.py (GH-36, thanks @clairernovotny)
  - Symbol extraction for `.cs` files: classes, interfaces, structs, enums, records, methods
  - Added `*.cs` to git grep reference search patterns

## [flow-next 0.7.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Collision-resistant epic IDs**: New epics use `fn-N-xxx` format with 3-char alphanumeric suffix
  - Prevents ID collisions when team members create epics simultaneously
  - Cryptographically secure suffix using Python `secrets` module
  - Legacy `fn-N` format still supported (backwards compatible)
  - Example: `fn-1-abc`, `fn-42-z9k`, tasks: `fn-1-abc.1`

### Changed
- Updated TUI to parse new ID format in run discovery
- Updated Ralph receipt parsing for new format
- Updated all error messages to mention both `fn-N` and `fn-N-xxx` formats

### Fixed
- **Codex reviews from `/tmp` dirs**: Added `--skip-git-repo-check` to `codex exec` (GH-33)
  - Fixes "not a git repo" errors when reviewing cloned/temp repos
  - Safe: reviews run with read-only sandbox
- **Ralph Ctrl+C handling**: Signal now properly terminates entire process tree
  - Added cleanup trap for SIGINT/SIGTERM in all modes
  - Fixed `timeout --foreground` detection for proper signal propagation

## [flow-next 0.6.3] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Spec file input for `/flow-next:work`**: Pass `.md` files directly to create epic and start work
  - `/flow-next:work docs/my-spec.md` creates epic from file, sets plan, creates task, executes
  - Detection order: task ID > epic ID > .md file > idea text
  - No changes to Ralph or existing workflows

## [flow-next-tui 0.1.1] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **CI/CD workflow**: `.github/workflows/publish-tui.yml`
  - Triggers on push to main (flow-next-tui/**) or workflow_dispatch
  - Test matrix: ubuntu + macos, lint, test, pack-test
  - npm publish with OIDC trusted publishing (no NPM_TOKEN needed)
  - Version detection: only publishes when version differs from npm
- **Bump script**: `scripts/bump.sh` for semver version management
- Screenshot in README (replaces ASCII layout diagram)

### Changed
- README intro now explains what Flow-Next and Ralph are

## [flow-next 0.6.2] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **TUI documentation**: Ralph docs now include TUI quickstart with screenshot
- TUI links in README and ralph.md

## [flow-next 0.6.1] - 2026-01-12

### Changed
- Ralph now always outputs stream-json to logs (TUI compatibility)
  - `--watch` flag only controls terminal display, not log format
  - Logs always parseable by TUI regardless of watch mode

### Fixed
- Add `--verbose` to quiet mode (required by Claude CLI for `stream-json` + `--print`)
  - Without this, quiet mode errored: "output-format=stream-json requires --verbose"
- Skip artifact files in `.flow/tasks/` that don't have `id` field (GH-21)
  - Prevents `KeyError` crash when Claude writes temp files like `fn-1.1-evidence.json`
  - Affects: `next`, `list`, `ready`, `show`, `validate` commands
- Ralph now exports `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` based on `PLAN_REVIEW`/`WORK_REVIEW`
  - Skills inside Claude now see consistent backend config
  - Previously skills would re-detect and potentially choose different backend

## [flow-next 0.6.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **Watch mode**: `--watch` flag streams tool calls in real-time with TUI styling (icons, colors)
- **Watch verbose**: `--watch verbose` also streams model text responses
- `watch-filter.py` for stream-json parsing (fail-open pattern, drains stdin on error)
- **Review feedback in receipts**: Codex plan/impl review receipts now include `review` field with full feedback (enables fix loops)
- `FLOW_RALPH_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR` env var for testing with local dev plugin

### Changed
- Codex exec timeout increased 300s → 600s (matches RP timeout)
- Stream-json text extraction for reliable tag parsing in watch mode
- Conditional signal trap (only in watch mode)

### Fixed
- Improved Ctrl+C signal handling in watch mode

## [flow-next 0.5.9] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- Python 3.9 compat: use `Optional[int]` not `int|None`

### Changed
- RP timeout configurable via `FLOW_RP_TIMEOUT` env (default 1200s/20min)
- Increased default timeout from 600s to 1200s for large repo context builders

## [flow-next 0.5.8] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- Context gathering prompt for Codex reviews (cross-boundary checks, related patterns)
- Rust, C/C++, Java symbol extraction in `gather_context_hints`
- Extended `find_references` to search `.rs`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.java` files

- `ralph-init` asks user to choose if both RepoPrompt and Codex available
- Replace `--mode` with `--review` in all review prompts for consistency
- Review skills (plan-review, impl-review) now parse `--review` argument

### Changed
- Backend selection priority: `--review` arg > env > config > auto-detect

## [flow-next 0.5.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Ralph no longer fails on non-zero exit code when task actually succeeded (#11)
- Checks both `task_status=done` and `verdict=SHIP` before treating exit code as failure
- Prevents false failures from transient errors (telemetry, model fallback, etc.)

### Added

- Only prompts when not in Ralph mode (`FLOW_RALPH` not set)

## [flow-next 0.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- Codex option in plan/work skill setup questions (was missing from interactive flow)

### Fixed
- Plan and work skills now ask about Codex backend when available (not just RepoPrompt)
- Backend detection checks for both `codex` and `rp-cli` availability

## [flow-next 0.5.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Codex review backend** — cross-platform alternative to RepoPrompt (#5)
  - `flowctl codex plan-review` and `flowctl codex impl-review` commands
  - Uses GPT 5.2 High by default (no user config needed)
  - Session continuity via thread IDs in receipts
  - Context hints from changed files (symbols + references)
  - Same Carmack-level review criteria as RepoPrompt (7 plan + 7 impl)
- Backend selection: `flowctl config set review.backend codex` or `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` env
- Comprehensive smoke tests for codex commands and context hints

### Changed

- Evidence accessible via `flowctl show <task> --json | jq '.evidence'`

## [flow-next 0.4.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- Hook enforcement: `flowctl done` now requires `--evidence-json` and `--summary-file` flags
- Morning review workflow guide in ralph.md

### Fixed
- Evidence field was empty because Claude drifted and skipped --evidence-json flag

## [flow-next 0.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `BRANCH_MODE=new` now creates a single run branch (`ralph-<run-id>`) instead of per-epic branches
- All epics work on the same run branch, making cherry-pick/revert of individual epics easy
- branches.json format simplified: `{base_branch, run_branch}` instead of epic mappings

### Fixed
- Fixed duplicate plan reviews when working on multiple epics (stale `.flow/` state across branches)

## [flow-next 0.3.22] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Hook now tracks `flowctl done` with path/variable invocations ($FLOWCTL, .flow/bin/flowctl)

## [flow-next 0.3.21] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Re-review prompt now instructs reviewer to verify actual code, not just trust summary

## [flow 0.8.4] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- Removed incorrect `selected_paths` requirement for re-reviews (files auto-refresh)
- Re-review prompt now instructs reviewer to verify actual code, not just trust summary

### Notes
- Setup is opt-in only; flow-next continues to work via plugin as before
- Re-run `/flow-next:setup` after plugin updates to refresh local scripts

## [flow-next 0.3.7] - 2026-01-09

### Ralph: Autonomous Coding with Multi-Model Review Gates

This release introduces **Ralph**, a production-ready autonomous coding loop that goes beyond simple "code until tests pass" agents. Ralph implements **multi-model review gates** using [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com/?atp=KJbuL4) to send your plans and implementations to a different AI model for review.

**Why Ralph is different:**

- **Two-model review**: Your code is reviewed by a separate model (we recommend GPT-5.2 High), catching blind spots that self-review misses
- **Review loops until SHIP**: No "LGTM with nits" that get ignored—reviews block progress until the reviewer returns `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>`
- **Receipt-based gating**: Every review must produce a receipt proving it ran. No receipt = no progress. This prevents the agent from skipping steps
- **Guard hooks**: Deterministic enforcement of workflow rules—the agent can't drift from the prescribed flow

**Getting started:**

```bash
/flow-next:ralph-init    # Set up Ralph in your repo
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh   # Run the autonomous loop
```

See the [Ralph documentation](plugins/flow-next/docs/ralph.md) for the full guide.

### Technical Details

**Guard hooks** (only active when `FLOW_RALPH=1`):
- Block impl receipts unless `flowctl done` was called
- Block receipts missing required `id` field
- Warn on informal approvals without verdict tags
- Zero impact for non-Ralph users

**Autonomous mode system prompt** ensures the agent follows instructions precisely when running unattended.

</details>

## [flow-next 0.2.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Autonomous mode flags**: All commands now accept flags to bypass interactive questions
  ```bash
  # Interactive (asks questions)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching
  /flow-next:work fn-1

  # Autonomous (flags)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching --research=grep --no-review
  /flow-next:work fn-1 --branch=current --no-review

  # Autonomous (natural language)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching, use context-scout, skip review
  /flow-next:work fn-1 current branch, no review
  ```
  - `/flow-next:plan`: `--research=rp|grep`, `--review=rp|export|none`, `--no-review`
  - `/flow-next:work`: `--branch=current|new|worktree`, `--review=rp|export|none`, `--no-review`
  - `/flow-next:plan-review`: `--mode=rp|export`
  - `/flow-next:impl-review`: `--mode=rp|export`
- Natural language parsing also works ("use context-scout", "skip review", "current branch")
- First step toward fully autonomous Flow-Next operation

### Fixed
- Homepage URL now points to `/apps/flow-next` instead of `/apps/flow`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Re-review messages now require detailed fix explanations**
  - Template includes: what was wrong → what changed → why that approach
  - Plan reviews: section changes summary, trade-offs acknowledged
  - Impl reviews: file-by-file changes summary, architectural decisions
  - Helps reviewer understand HOW fixes were made, not just "trust me"
- **Fixed linebreak escaping in re-review messages**
  - Use raw `call chat_send` with JSON for multi-line messages
  - Bash single quotes don't interpret `\n` - now documented
- Added "Why detailed re-review messages?" explanation to both workflows

## [0.8.1] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **RepoPrompt v1.5.62+ now required** for review features
  - New `-t` flag for direct tab targeting (cleaner than `workspace tab` chaining)
  - Progress notifications during builder/chat execution
  - Updated all rp-cli references and examples
- **Re-review loop clarified**: Skip builder on re-reviews—discovery is done
  - Chat already has full context from initial review
  - Just augment selection with any files touched during fixes
  - Continue existing chat, don't start fresh
- Added "Why skip builder on re-reviews?" explanation to both workflows
- Downgrade path: `flow@0.8.0` for users on older RepoPrompt versions

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- **Review workflows now use "Context Over Convenience" approach**
  - Builder prompt simplified to intent only (e.g., "Review implementation of OAuth on current branch")
  - No longer stuffs builder with file lists or module details—let Builder discover context
  - Builder's handoff prompt becomes foundation; review criteria added on top (not replaced)
  - Explicit step to capture and reuse Builder's handoff prompt via `prompt get`
- **New philosophy section** at top of both workflow files
  - Introduces "RepoPrompt's Context Builder" once, then refers to it as "Builder"
- **New anti-patterns**: "Stuffing builder prompt", "Ignoring builder's handoff prompt"
- Phase 1 now composes concise summary (flexible: 1-2 sentences for simple, paragraph for complex epics)
- Phase 2/3 renamed to "Context Discovery & Selection" with clearer 4-step process:
  1. Run builder with intent
  2. Capture handoff prompt
  3. Review and augment selection
  4. Verify final selection
- Builder wait warning now explicitly says "do NOT send another builder command"
- Review criteria condensed (same content, fewer tokens)

### Why This Change
Builder is AI-powered—its strength is discovering related patterns, architectural context, and dependencies the reviewer needs. We already know the changed files/plan file; Builder's job is finding surrounding context. Previous approach was too prescriptive.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- Renamed `interview` skill to `flow-interview` (pattern consistency)
- Extracted question categories to `questions.md` (like `flow-work` has `phases.md`)

## [0.7.6] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- Stronger AskUserQuestion requirement with anti-pattern example

## [0.7.5] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- Interview skill now explicitly requires AskUserQuestion tool (was outputting questions as text)

## [0.7.4] - 2026-01-03

  - Note: subagents won't run (Codex limitation), core flow still works

## [0.7.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Review skills now check conversation context before asking mode question
  - If mode already chosen in `/flow:plan` or `/flow:work` setup → use it, don't ask again
  - Only asks when invoked directly without prior context

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Clarified review mode question: both modes use RepoPrompt for context building, difference is where review happens

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Export for external review**: Review skills now offer export mode for ChatGPT Pro, Claude web, etc.
  - `/flow:plan` and `/flow:work` setup questions now have 3 review options:
    - `a) Yes, RepoPrompt chat` (default)
    - `b) Yes, export for external LLM`
    - `c) No`
  - Direct `/flow:impl-review` and `/flow:plan-review` ask upfront which mode to use
  - Export mode: same context building, exports to `~/Desktop/` and opens file
  - Uses new RepoPrompt 1.5.61 `prompt export` command

### Changed
- Updated rp-cli references for RepoPrompt 1.5.61:
  - `workspace tabs` shorthand (replaces verbose `call manage_workspaces`)
  - `workspace tab "name"` shorthand for tab selection
  - `prompt export /path.md` for full context export
  - Workflow shorthand flags (`--export-prompt`, `--export-context`)
  - Note: chats are now bound to compose tabs

## [0.6.5] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- Remove "Top 3 changes" from review output format
  - Agents were only fixing top 3 instead of ALL Critical/Major/Minor issues
  - Added explicit instruction: list ALL issues, agent will fix all of them
  - Applies to both plan-review and impl-review workflows

## [0.6.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- Clarified valid reasons to skip a fix in reviews:
  - Reviewer lacked context (missed constraint/related code)
  - Reviewer misunderstood requirement/intent
  - Fix would break something else
  - Conflicts with established patterns
  - Must explain reasoning in re-review message

## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-30

  - Added note to keep message concise (chat sees selected files)

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Added fix-and-re-review loop to plan/impl review workflows
  - Agents were documenting issues instead of fixing them during re-review
  - Now explicitly instructs to implement all fixes directly
  - Escape hatch for genuine disagreements preserved
  - Updated anti-patterns to flag "documenting instead of fixing"

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-30

### Added

  - `builder` auto-creates isolated compose tabs
  - Chain commands to maintain tab context: `builder "..." && select add && chat`
  - Rebind by tab name for separate invocations
  - Updated: flow-plan-review, flow-impl-review workflows
  - Updated: context-scout agent, rp-explorer skill

## [0.5.16] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Fixed new chat creation in reviews (shorthand `--new-chat` is broken in rp-cli)
  - Initial review now uses `call chat_send {"new_chat": true, ...}` (works)
  - Re-review uses shorthand `chat "..." --mode chat` (continues existing)
  - Updated both workflow.md and rp-cli-reference.md files

## [0.5.15] - 2025-12-29

  - Only ask if something is actually unclear or blocking

## [0.5.13] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Replaced AskUserQuestion with text-based questions in flow-plan and flow-work
  - Better for voice dictation users
  - Supports terse replies ("1a 2b") and natural language rambling
  - All questions visible at once
  - Explicit "do NOT use AskUserQuestion tool" instruction

## [0.5.12] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- Issue quality guidelines in review prompts (inspired by OpenAI Codex)
  - impl-review: only flag issues **introduced by this change**
  - Both: cite **actual affected code** (no speculation)
  - Both: specify **trigger conditions** (inputs, edge cases)

## [0.5.11] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Restructured chat command examples so `--new-chat` flags aren't buried

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- Chat session targeting for re-reviews
  - `chats list` → get chat IDs and names
  - `--chat-id <id>` → continue specific chat

## [0.5.9] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Clarified new-chat behavior in review workflows

## [0.5.8] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Added prominent "CRITICAL" instruction for chat management in review workflows

## [0.5.7] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Merged redundant verify phases in review workflows
  - `flow-plan-review`: Phase 2+3 → "Build Context & Verify Selection"
  - `flow-impl-review`: Phase 3+4 → "Build Context & Verify Selection"
  - Agent now adds all supporting docs found in earlier phases after builder runs
  - Eliminates duplicate "check for PRD" instructions

## [0.5.6] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Improved skill descriptions to explicitly mention Beads issue ID support
  - `flow-plan`: now triggers on issue IDs (e.g., bd-123, gno-45)
  - `flow-work`: now triggers on epic/issue IDs for execution

## [0.5.4] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **New skill: `rp-explorer`** - Token-efficient codebase exploration via rp-cli
  - Deliberate activation: triggers on "use rp", "use repoprompt", explicit requests
  - Includes full rp-cli command reference (progressive disclosure)

### Changed
- `/flow:plan` now asks two setup questions when rp-cli detected:
  - Q1: Research approach (context-scout vs repo-scout)
  - Q2: Auto-review preference
- Updated README with comparison table and SETUP phase diagram

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-28

### Changed
- Documented cross-model review benefit (GPT-5.2 High, o3 for validation)

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **New agent: `context-scout`** - Token-efficient codebase exploration using RepoPrompt's rp-cli
  - Uses `structure` for code signatures (10x fewer tokens than full files)
  - Uses `builder` for AI-powered file discovery
  - Comprehensive workflow: window setup → explore → summarize

### Changed
- **Improved all 6 agents** with proper configuration and detailed prompts:
  - Added `tools` field - each agent now has only the tools it needs
  - Added `model` field - scouts use `haiku` (fast), analysts use `sonnet` (reasoning)
  - Detailed search/analysis methodologies
  - Structured output formats for consistent, actionable results
  - Clear rules on what to focus on and what to skip

### Technical
- All 6 agents use opus model with full research toolkit: Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/WebSearch/WebFetch
- Explicitly excludes Edit/Write (read-only), Task (no sub-agents), TodoWrite/AskUserQuestion (parent manages)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Auto-offer review**: Both `flow-plan` and `flow-work` now detect if rp-cli is installed and offer Carmack-level review
  - `flow-plan`: After writing plan, offers `/flow:plan-review` before next steps
  - `flow-work`: After shipping, offers `/flow:impl-review` with fix-and-iterate loop
- Eliminates need for manual chaining like "then review with /flow:impl-review"

### Changed
- `flow-work`: Branch setup question now in SKILL.md (first thing shown, cannot be skipped)
- Explicit examples of chained instructions in skill inputs

### Fixed
- Review commands now have explicit wait instructions for rp-cli chat responses (1-5+ min timeout)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Beads integration**: Optional Beads (`bd`) support for flow skills
  - `flow-plan`: Can create Beads epics/tasks instead of markdown plans
  - `flow-work`: Can accept Beads IDs/titles, track via `bd ready`/`bd update`/`bd close`
  - `flow-plan-review`: Can accept Beads IDs/titles as input
  - `flow-impl-review`: Looks for Beads context during code review
- Graceful fallback to markdown/TodoWrite when `bd` unavailable
- Context recovery guidance per Anthropic's long-running agent best practices

### Technical
- Agent-first design: no rigid detection gates, uses judgment based on context
- Validated against bd v0.38.0
- CLI behavior documented in plan (ID formats, parent linking, scoped ready)

## [0.3.7] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- `/flow:plan-review` command: Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli context builder + chat
- `/flow:impl-review` command: Carmack-level implementation review of current branch changes
- `flow-plan-review` skill: progressive disclosure with workflow.md + rp-cli-reference.md
- `flow-impl-review` skill: progressive disclosure with workflow.md + rp-cli-reference.md

### Technical
- Both review skills use rp-cli for context building and chat-based review
- Shared rp-cli-reference.md for CLI command reference
- Commands are thin wrappers (~15 lines) invoking skills

## [0.2.3] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use "subagent" terminology consistently (official Claude Code term)

## [0.2.2] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use namespaced agent names (`flow:repo-scout`, `flow:practice-scout`, etc.) in skill reference files
- Make workflow file references directive ("Read and follow" instead of passive links)

## [0.2.1] - 2024-12-27

### Changed
- **Progressive disclosure for Skills**: SKILL.md files now contain only overview + links to reference files
- `flow-plan`: 117 → 30 lines in SKILL.md, detailed steps moved to `steps.md` and `examples.md`
- `flow-work`: 95 → 27 lines in SKILL.md, phases moved to `phases.md`
- Context usage reduced: ~100-150 tokens per skill at startup instead of 400-700

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- `flow-plan` skill: planning workflow logic extracted from command
- `flow-work` skill: execution workflow logic extracted from command

### Changed
- **Commands → Skills refactor**: `/flow:plan` and `/flow:work` are now thin wrappers (~15 lines each) that invoke Skills
- Skills enable auto-triggering based on description matching (e.g., "plan out adding OAuth" triggers `flow-plan`)
- Updated manifests: 1 skill → 3 skills

### Technical
- Commands reduced from ~2.1k and ~2.4k tokens to ~36 and ~38 tokens
- Full logic loads on-demand when skill is triggered

## [0.1.1] - 2024-12-26

### Changed
- Moved commands to `commands/flow/` subdirectory for prefixed naming (`/flow:plan`, `/flow:work`)
- Renamed commands for clarity
- Updated argument hints

### Added
- Semver bump script for version management

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-26

### Added
- Initial release of Flow plugin
- `/flow:plan` command: research + produce `plans/<slug>.md`
- `/flow:work` command: execute a plan end-to-end
- 5 agents: `repo-scout`, `practice-scout`, `docs-scout`, `flow-gap-analyst`, `quality-auditor`
- `worktree-kit` skill for safe parallel git workspaces
- Issue creation integration (GitHub, Linear, Beads)
- Marketplace structure with plugin manifest
