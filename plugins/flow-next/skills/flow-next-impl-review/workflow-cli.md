# Implementation Review Workflow — CLI Backends

Use when `BACKEND` is `codex`, `claude`, `copilot` or `cursor`. Prerequisite: Phase 0 backend detection in [workflow-common.md](workflow-common.md) has resolved `BACKEND`, `FLOWCTL`, and (optionally) `TASK_ID` / `BASE_COMMIT`. Every CLI backend takes the same steps through the same flowctl commands; only the reviewer CLI behind them differs (see "Backend notes" below).

## Critical Rules (CLI backends)

1. Use the `$FLOWCTL $BACKEND` review commands exclusively — never call the reviewer CLI directly
2. **The FIRST review round of a scope is the two-phase fan-out**: `impl-review-fanout` (dispatch), your merge, `impl-review-fanout-finalize` (finalize), sized by the panel rule in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Re-review rounds after fixes are a single `impl-review` with `--receipt`
3. Pass `--receipt` throughout — the finalize writes the merged receipt; re-reviews resume from it
4. Parse verdict from command output

## Step 1: Identify Task and Diff Base

```bash
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"

# Use BASE_COMMIT from arguments if provided (task-scoped review)
# Otherwise fall back to main/master (full branch review)
if [[ -z "$BASE_COMMIT" ]]; then
  DIFF_BASE="main"
  git rev-parse main >/dev/null 2>&1 || DIFF_BASE="master"
else
  DIFF_BASE="$BASE_COMMIT"
fi

git log ${DIFF_BASE}..HEAD --oneline
```

## Step 2: Fan-out dispatch (phase one — first round only)

The first round dispatches one reviewer draw or three, by the panel rule in
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Three draws run one per fixed axis lens (`correctness`,
`contracts`, `integration`), each differing from the base prompt by exactly one
added axis line, on the same resolved backend/model the single dispatch uses; one
draw runs the correctness lens. The fan-out is TWO blocking foreground flowctl
invocations with your merge between them; this is the first. Apply the foreground duration
rule in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) before dispatch. `review.fanoutExecution` defaults to
`concurrent`; opt-in `sequential` completes each draw before starting the next.

```bash
# FOREGROUND RULE: one blocking foreground Bash call; concurrent timeout 600s.
# Sequential fan-out uses the duration rule above; stop if the host cannot supervise it.
# NEVER run_in_background + monitor - a background completion does not resume a subagent context.
# ROUTE: ONE deterministic verb owns canonicalization (fn-N.M ->
# fn-N-slug.M), the repo/scope-keyed receipt path (explicit REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH
# always wins), receipt identity + verdict routing, stale-receipt rotation, and
# the task-mode ledger fences (in-flight round, unjournaled reservation, lost
# receipt on an open cycle, deep-overturned receipt, NEEDS_HUMAN). Branch on its
# action — never re-derive any of that in shell. flowctl's first-round guard
# stays the no-cost exit-2 backstop behind it.
ROUTE="$($FLOWCTL review-route ${TASK_ID:+"$TASK_ID"} --rotate-stale --json)" || { printf '%s\n' "$ROUTE" >&2; exit 1; }
ACTION="$(jq -r '.action' <<<"$ROUTE")"
TASK_ID="$(jq -r '.task_id // empty' <<<"$ROUTE")"
RECEIPT_PATH="$(jq -r '.receipt_path' <<<"$ROUTE")"
RESUMED=0
case "$ACTION" in
  stop)
    # The message names the condition and the repair (NEEDS_HUMAN-prefixed).
    jq -r '.message' <<<"$ROUTE" >&2; exit 1 ;;
  fix-then-rereview)
    RESUMED=1
    # Context may have been lost BEFORE the fixes were applied: resume at
    # Step 5.1 (parse the receipt's findings, fix, test, commit) and reach the
    # 5.4 single-dispatch re-review only once the fixes are committed.
    echo "RESUMED SCOPE — receipt carries an active fix loop; skip Steps 2-4, resume at Step 5.1 (parse findings from the receipt, fix, test, commit — then the 5.4 single-dispatch re-review; if the fixes are already committed, verify and go straight to 5.4)" ;;
esac

# Standalone branch reviews leave TASK_ID empty — OMIT the positional entirely
# (a quoted "" is rejected as an invalid task id; standalone mode needs no task arg).
# ONE_REVIEWER=1 when the panel rule in SKILL.md calls for one reviewer (adds
# --draw correctness); otherwise the default three draws run.
# DEFAULT topology only — when the user gave a steering instruction ("use 1
# reviewer instead of 3", "three different model families"), read "Steering
# draw topology" below and add the explicit --draw args BEFORE running this.
# Standalone reviews also carry the caller's focus areas via --focus "<areas>".
ONE_REVIEWER=0
args=()
[ -n "$TASK_ID" ] && args+=("$TASK_ID")
args+=(--base "$DIFF_BASE" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH" --json)
[ "$ONE_REVIEWER" = 1 ] && args+=(--draw correctness)
# FOCUS_AREAS = the invocation's trailing focus-areas text (Step 0 parsing);
# STANDALONE only - it rides the draw prompts, the sidecar meta, and the
# receipt for re-review. Task-scoped draws take their focus from the task
# spec (flowctl refuses --focus with a task).
[ -z "$TASK_ID" ] && [ -n "$FOCUS_AREAS" ] && args+=(--focus "$FOCUS_AREAS")
[ "$RESUMED" = "1" ] || $FLOWCTL "$BACKEND" impl-review-fanout "${args[@]}"
```

What the dispatch does (facts you rely on, not steps you take):

- Task mode reserves exactly **ONE** review round for the whole fan-out
  (standalone reserves none; a per-invocation nonce serves as the `rid`).
- Draws run concurrently by default, each under its own timeout. With
  `review.fanoutExecution=sequential`, each draw completes its terminal sidecars
  and progress before the next starts, in supplied axis order. Failed draws
  complete and remain recorded before the next starts; there are no draw retries.
- Per-draw sidecars land at `.flow/review-fanout/<rid>/`: `<axis>.review.md`
  (the extracted reviewer message — what you merge), `<axis>.json` (metadata
  incl. verdict/session), `<axis>.out.txt` (raw), `meta.json`, `progress.log`.
  The JSON output lists the paths, per-draw verdicts, the `rid`, and the exact
  finalize command to run next.
- **First-round guard:** a `--receipt` already carrying prior findings or a
  resumable session is refused — fan-out never runs on round 2+.
- **Partial fan-out fails open:** one draw with a verdict is enough to proceed;
  failed draws are recorded in `failed_draws`, never retried, and never block.
  Only an all-draws-no-verdict dispatch is a transport failure — one refund,
  today's durable semantics (counts toward `MAX_REVIEW_TRANSPORT_FAILURES`,
  never the verdict counter).

### Steering draw topology (prose, never flags-in-config)

**You own the draw topology.** Parse the user's instruction here and pass
explicit `--draw AXIS[=BACKEND[:MODEL[:EFFORT]]]` arguments — flowctl never
reads prose. Worked phrasings:

- "use 1 reviewer instead of 3" → a single draw: `--draw correctness`
- "use three different model families for the review fan-out" → three explicit
  per-draw backend specs, e.g. `--draw correctness=codex:<model>:medium
  --draw contracts=cursor:<model> --draw integration=claude:<model>:high`
  — three genuinely distinct families; cross-family is three explicit
  dispatch specs, never a config key. Spec grammar per backend lives in
  [references/backend-specs.md](references/backend-specs.md); model ids are
  illustrative — the backend CLI is the availability authority
- Ambiguous phrasing → default three same-backend draws (say so and proceed)

Enforced constraint (flowctl, not convention): the **primary draw
(`correctness` — or, when `correctness` isn't drawn, the first draw) must run
on `$BACKEND`**, the backend whose command runs the fan-out — the finalize stamps
the merged receipt's top-level session/model from it and round 2+ resumes that
session through `$FLOWCTL $BACKEND impl-review`, so a primary on another backend
is refused with exit 2. The other draws may name any CLI backend.

## Step 3: Coordinator merge (judgment — yours)

Read each surviving draw's `<axis>.review.md` and author a merge-plan JSON:

```json
{"keep":["correctness:1","integration:2"],"collapse":{"standards:1":"correctness:1"}}
```

References are `<axis>:<parsed finding ordinal>`. `keep` orders the output;
`collapse` maps a duplicate to its kept representative. Omitted findings are
your evidence-gate drops. Targets must be kept; missing ids fail before recording.
Flowctl renders the document and counts distinct `introduced` survivors from
NEEDS_WORK draws, including a NEEDS_WORK duplicate collapsed into a SHIP
representative; kept `pre_existing` items stay in the document but never count. The
legacy `--merged-file` plus `--needs-work-survivors` route remains available for
repairing unparseable draw output. Keep these judgment rules:

- **Same-defect dedupe** is judgment: findings describing the same defect from
  different draws collapse to one entry, keeping the strongest evidence.
- **Evidence bar:** omit findings that fail it. Optional `suppressed_count`
  maps confidence anchors to counts, e.g. `{"50":3,"0":2}`. Count each
  suppressed defect once per anchor even when several draws suppressed it;
  same-defect dedupe of these counts remains your judgment. Coverage gaps
  (`unaddressed` R-IDs) are preserved from the draw tallies automatically.
- **Ranked output with an Act-On tier capped at 5 — non-blocking tiers only** —
  plus a published remainder: considered-and-deferred must be distinguishable
  from never-seen, so remainder items stay in the merged document (they enter
  the findings container as deferred lineage across rounds), never silently
  dropped. **Every surviving introduced blocking finding is fixed regardless of
  count** — the cap never trims blockers; the fix-loop contract is unchanged.
- **Axis provenance lives in your prose report** (e.g. "the integration draw
  surfaced #3 and #7"), never as a field on finding items — the v1 findings
  schema's closed allowlist is untouched.
- **Survivor count is derived:** the merge-plan owns the draw attribution;
  finalize computes the count and applies the zero-survivor wedge.
- Keep the draws' output format (Severity / Confidence / Classification /
  File:Line / R-IDs per finding, the `## Pre-existing issues` section, coverage
  table and tally lines where present) and end with exactly one verdict tag.
  The finalize computes the verdict mechanically — worst-wins over the draws'
  tags, with the zero-survivor wedge as the only exception — and your tag
  NEVER changes it in either direction: a mismatch (worse or milder) is
  stamped on the receipt as `merged_tag_mismatch`. Escalation beyond the draws
  belongs to the post-finalize optional phases, which own their own verdict
  transitions.

## Step 4: Finalize (phase two)

```bash
# FOREGROUND RULE: run this as ONE blocking foreground Bash call (timeout 600s).
# NEVER run_in_background + monitor - a background completion does not resume a subagent context.
# The reservation metadata derives task, base and receipt; use literal paths.
args=(--rid "<rid from phase-one JSON>" --merge-plan "<merge-plan JSON path>" --json)
# Scope ownership through the optional phases: when --deep,
# --validate, or --interactive is enabled, hold the lease at the finalize —
# review-route and the reservation gate refuse any other dispatch on this
# scope until you release it after the phases (Step 4 tail below). Expires
# on the liveness bound, so a dead coordinator never wedges the scope.
# Step 0 printed OPTIONAL_PHASES_COUNT; restate it here as a LITERAL (shell
# state does not survive across tool calls). 0 when no optional flag is set.
OPTIONAL_PHASES_COUNT="<count printed by Step 0>"
PHASES_RESUME_SESSION="<1 or 0 printed by Step 0>"
[ -n "$OPTIONAL_PHASES_COUNT" ] && [ "$OPTIONAL_PHASES_COUNT" != "0" ] && args+=(--hold-for-phases "$OPTIONAL_PHASES_COUNT")
[ "$PHASES_RESUME_SESSION" = "1" ] && args+=(--phases-resume-session)
FINALIZE_JSON="$($FLOWCTL "$BACKEND" impl-review-fanout-finalize "${args[@]}")"
FINALIZE_EXIT=$?
# Print the rendered document and derived count with the verdict.
printf '%s' "$FINALIZE_JSON" | jq -c '.' 2>/dev/null || printf '%s\n' "$FINALIZE_JSON"
printf '<verdict>%s</verdict>\n' "$(printf '%s' "$FINALIZE_JSON" | jq -r '.verdict // empty' 2>/dev/null)"
exit "$FINALIZE_EXIT"
```

If the finalize refuses with `no resumable primary session` (the primary
draw failed and no surviving draw carries a session on the review's backend),
the deep / validator passes cannot run this round: re-run it WITHOUT
`--phases-resume-session`, keeping `--hold-for-phases` only when
`--interactive` is enabled (count 1), skip the deep / validator passes, and
say so in the output. The interactive walkthrough still runs.

The finalizer is deterministic and atomic — only it records or refunds:

- **Verdict = mechanical worst-wins** over the draws' verdict tags
  (`NEEDS_HUMAN > MAJOR_RETHINK > NEEDS_WORK > SHIP`); failed draws do not
  vote. No draw's verdict is judged away.
- **Wedge escalation:** a `NEEDS_WORK` round with zero actionable survivors
  from the NEEDS_WORK draws (derived from the merge-plan; the legacy merged-file
  route requires `--needs-work-survivors`) escalates to `NEEDS_HUMAN` rather
  than looping against an unchanged artifact — per NEEDS_WORK draw, so
  SHIP-draw remainder items never mask an all-filtered NEEDS_WORK.
- Records the attempt, the single v1 findings container (ordinals re-assigned
  1..N across the union), the merged receipt, and the ONE round consumption
  atomically. Receipt top-level `session_id`/`model` are the primary
  (correctness) draw's — or, when the primary FAILED (or returned no
  session), the first surviving draw's on the same backend, so round 2 and the
  optional phases still get a resumable session; `draws[]` honestly records
  each draw's axis, model, session_id, verdict, and failed flag either way (the
  failed primary included).
- Re-invocable with the same merged file (quiet replay) — recoverable after a
  coordinator crash. A run that dies between dispatch and finalize leaves a
  write-ahead refund-intent journal that the next reservation replays as a
  refunded transport failure — never hand-repair it.

## Optional phases (gated by flags)

When `--deep` / `--validate` / `--interactive` fired, run the gated phases from
[optional-phases.md](optional-phases.md) — the dispatch matches the `$BACKEND`
case in each phase — **AFTER `impl-review-fanout-finalize`, against the merged
findings it recorded: still exactly ONCE per round, never per draw, and always
before the fix pass.** The ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic: the
deep-pass and validator dispatches resume from the merged receipt, and only the
finalize writes it — run between merge and finalize they hit an absent or
session-less receipt and error out; and the walkthrough's receipt updates must
land after the finalize's rebuild, which would otherwise clobber them. Fold
what survives into the fix pass, never back into the already-finalized merged
document.

See [optional-phases.md](optional-phases.md) "Phase ordering & flag-combination matrix" for the order when multiple flags are set.

**Scope ownership spans the optional phases:** the same-scope
single-driver rule does not end at the finalize — this coordinator owns the
scope until its post-finalize optional phases complete, because a deep or
validator pass may still overturn the finalized verdict. That ownership is
DURABLE, not prose: the finalize's `--hold-for-phases N` writes a lease
(acquired BEFORE the record, while the reservation still stands; TTL sized
for N passes) that `review-route` and the reservation gate refuse across.
Release it as the LAST step of the optional phases, before the fix pass —
release is bound to the owning rid:

```bash
# After every enabled optional phase has run (deep, validator, walkthrough).
# The rid is typed as a LITERAL from the phase-one JSON (shell state does not
# survive across tool calls) — release is bound to it.
$FLOWCTL review-route ${TASK_ID:+"$TASK_ID"} --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH" --release-phases --rid "<rid from phase-one JSON>" --json
```

A coordinator that dies mid-phase does not wedge the scope — the lease
expires on the liveness bound.

## Step 5: Handle Verdict

If `VERDICT=NEEDS_WORK`:
1. Parse issues from the merged output
2. Fix code and run tests
3. Commit fixes
4. **Re-review is a single dispatch** — the fan-out is first-round only:

```bash
# FOREGROUND RULE: run this as ONE blocking foreground Bash call (timeout 600s).
# NEVER run_in_background + monitor - a background completion does not resume a subagent context.
# Bash state does NOT survive across tool calls (the fix/test/commit steps ran
# between) — re-derive the Step-1 values in THIS block rather than reading
# stale variables; TASK_ID and BACKEND are literals from the invocation context.
ROUTE="$($FLOWCTL review-route ${TASK_ID:+"$TASK_ID"} --json)"   # pure: canonical TASK_ID + receipt path (no rotation, no state change)
TASK_ID="$(jq -r '.task_id // empty' <<<"$ROUTE")"
RECEIPT_PATH="$(jq -r '.receipt_path' <<<"$ROUTE")"
if [[ -z "$BASE_COMMIT" ]]; then
  DIFF_BASE="main"
  git rev-parse main >/dev/null 2>&1 || DIFF_BASE="master"
else
  DIFF_BASE="$BASE_COMMIT"
fi
args=()
[ -n "$TASK_ID" ] && args+=("$TASK_ID")
args+=(--base "$DIFF_BASE" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH")
$FLOWCTL "$BACKEND" impl-review "${args[@]}"
```

   When the receipt carries `draws[]`, flowctl resumes the primary session and
   injects the FULL merged prior-finding container into the dispatch prompt
   (every merged ordinal present): the resumed session did not author the
   other axes' findings. Automatic — no flag.
5. The re-review's verdict is terminal ([other-paths.md](other-paths.md) § Fix Loop) unless working-rules.md's review loop applies (an unattended run, or a request to review until SHIP): never start a second fix pass; surface surviving findings to the caller.

**Output includes `VERDICT=SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK|NEEDS_HUMAN`.**

## Step 6: Receipt

The merged receipt is written by `impl-review-fanout-finalize` (and updated by
`impl-review` on re-reviews) when `--receipt` is provided. Format: the existing
top-level shape (`{"type":"impl_review","id":"<id>","mode":"<backend>","verdict":"<verdict>","session_id":"<id>","model":"<model>","spec":"<backend>:<model>[:<effort>]","timestamp":"..."}`, plus `effort` where the backend has one)
plus the `draws[]` array recording the fan-out honestly. A re-review rewrite
drops `draws[]` from the LIVE receipt (re-review rounds have no draws); the
fan-out provenance persists in the receipt history and in the
`.flow/review-fanout/<rid>/` sidecar's `meta.json` alongside the per-draw raw
outputs, for audit.

Session resume guard: a re-review resumes the session only when the receipt's
`mode` is this backend; a cross-backend switch (another backend's receipt at the
same path) starts a fresh session.

## Backend notes

Model and effort resolve, first match wins: `--spec <backend>:<model>[:<effort>]`, per-task
`review` (`flowctl task set-backend`), the `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` spec, the
`FLOW_<BACKEND>_MODEL` / `FLOW_<BACKEND>_EFFORT` env vars (cursor: model only), then the
registry defaults.
Grammar and defaults: [references/backend-specs.md](references/backend-specs.md).

- **codex** — `codex exec` under a read-only sandbox (Unix default). A sandbox-blocked
  reviewer means something asked it to write: fix that, never widen `--sandbox`.
- **claude** — headless `claude -p` with only `Read`, `Grep` and `Glob` (no shell, no write
  tool, no MCP), the prompt on stdin. It cannot run `git diff`, so every primary dispatch
  writes the reviewed range to `.flow/tmp/claude-review/` and names that path in the prompt;
  each draw gets its own file. Effort `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`; at the resolution
  ladder's floor no model or effort is sent and the receipt records `"effort": null`.
  On a Claude-family writer the review is same-family: the receipt records it and the run
  proceeds; prefer `codex` or `host` when family independence matters.
- **copilot** — the Copilot CLI; session ids are client-minted (create-or-resume).
- **cursor** — `cursor-agent -p --output-format json --trust --mode ask` (read-only). No
  effort field: Cursor folds effort into the model name, and `cursor:<model>:<effort>` is
  rejected.

---

## Anti-patterns (CLI backends)

- **Direct reviewer CLI calls** - Must use the `flowctl <backend>` wrappers
- **Inventing a `--model`/`--effort` CLI flag** - Use `--spec` or the backend's env vars
- **Widening the reviewer's tools or sandbox** - Reviewers are read-only by contract
- **Fabricating a first-call resume id** - The first call starts fresh; resume uses the session the receipt recorded
- **Fanning out on round 2+** - First round only; the guard refuses a receipt with prior findings, and re-reviews resume the primary session
- **Axis provenance on finding items** - It lives in your merge prose; the findings schema's allowlist is closed
- **Retrying a failed draw** - Partial fan-out fails open; a failed draw never blocks, retries, or consumes extra rounds
- **Skipping the finalize** - The dispatch records nothing; a merge without `impl-review-fanout-finalize` leaves a charged round that the refund-intent journal will refund as a transport failure
